The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</p>

<p spacebefore='-4.2679pt'/>
<p>The history of human progress is, at its core, the history of machines, just as the ancient Greeks built the Antikythera mechanism to predict eclipses and Leonardo da Vinci envisioned machines to fly. Today, as large language models (LLMs) begin to approximate—and in some domains, surpass—human cognitive abilities, a natural question arises:</p>
<p spacebefore='-4.2679pt'>
[leftmargin=1em, rightmargin=1em]

<hi rend='it'>Can computational models, like humans, conceive and create complex machines to achieve purposeful goals?</hi></p>
<p spacebefore='-0.99585pt'><hi rend='it'>
</hi></p>
<p spacebefore='-10.66977pt'/>
<p>At the heart of this question lie two tightly coupled concepts: <hi rend='it'>compositionality</hi>, how parts are put together into assemblies, and <hi rend='it'>functionality</hi>, the tasks these assemblies perform as they interact with external forces or inputs. While foundation models are already capable of synthesizing 3D shapes and building mechanical parts with computer-aided design (CAD) models, it is the complex compositional structures, in which very different parts and components are orchestrated to smoothly move together, that realize a vast array of demands.
Just as a clock emerges from the composition of simple and standardized mechanical elements such as gears and flywheels, these same elements, when combined differently, can give rise to entirely different machines, such as a sewing machine. On the other hand, the same functionality may be realized by different part compositions, just as both cars and bicycles can transport a person from place to place. Put it concisely: <hi rend='it'>composition is shaped by functionality, and functionality is realized through composition</hi>. Since such compositional machines can be expressed programmatically, with types, placements and articulations of parts represented in structured code that LLMs can generate and manipulate, we formalize the above question as:</p>
<p spacebefore='-4.2679pt'>
[leftmargin=1em, rightmargin=1em]

<hi rend='it'>Can LLMs, given standardized mechanical parts and a reward function for the desired functionality, discover diverse spatial part compositions that maximize the reward and complete the task?</hi></p>
<p spacebefore='-0.99585pt'><hi rend='it'>
</hi></p>
<p spacebefore='-10.66977pt'/>
<p>The question is not only about the pursuit of intelligence but also about the practice of engineering. Modern design pipelines are often long and costly, especially in large-scale projects where each iteration demands substantial resources. These projects accumulate vast collections of documents and blueprints, making it difficult to trace, retrieve, or reuse past design efforts. Much essential know-how is passed informally across teams and generations, and in many cases, never fully recorded and since forgotten. An automated machine design system could directly address these challenges.</p>
<p>Rather than merely mimicking patterns from historical designs, such a system should be agentic: capable of exploring the exponentially large design space, leveraging prior knowledge to create novel designs for new demands and constraints, and improving them through feedback. To investigate this concretely, we introduce <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, an interactive environment built on the machine-design game of Besiege<note id-text='1' id='uid2' place='foot'><xref url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besiege_(video_game)'>https://<allowbreak/>en.<allowbreak/>wikipedia.<allowbreak/>org/<allowbreak/>wiki/<allowbreak/>Besiege_(video_game)</xref></note>. The environment
allows for construction of simple mechanical machines with standardized and semantic parts such as gears and wheels, and
supports customized physical scenarios in which LLM agents can test constructed machines and evaluate their dynamics and interactions.</p>
<p>Building on <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with different agent designs and strategies for selecting and placing basic mechanical elements to build machines for representative functional demands, a task we term <hi rend='it'>compositional machine design</hi>. Through these experiments, we empirically identify key capabilities required for this task: accurate spatial reasoning, high-level knowledge of design strategies, and instruction-following in spatial domains. Since only a few proprietary LLMs achieve satisfactory results, we further investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the performance of open-source LLMs. To this end, we curate a small machine design dataset to cold-start RL finetuning, perform exploratory RL experiments, and highlight key challenges that chart directions for future research. In summary, our contributions are listed below:</p>

<p spacebefore='-5.69054pt'/>
<p>Full machine design involves many coupled elements: geometry, statics and dynamics, demand analysis, failure modes, safety, and even legal constraints <cit><ref target='bid0'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid1'/></cit>. To isolate a tractable subproblem, we focus on the structural composition of machines: how standardized parts are spatially arranged and mechanically linked to produce functional behavior. We refer to this task, introduced in the previous section, as <hi rend='it'>compositional machine design</hi>. It captures two essential components: (i) the static geometry of a machine as a part-based assembly, and (ii) its compatibility with functional demands, typically assessed through physical simulation. This abstraction omits considerations such as manufacturing constraints, material properties, or domain-specific regulations, but retains the core spatial and behavioral reasoning challenges relevant to design.</p>
<p>This special task of compositional machine design mirrors challenges found in other exploration domains. For example, automatic theorem proving involves a compositional and exponentially large action space, while electronic design automation (EDA) for chip layouts requires spatial reasoning to place components of varying shapes under spatial constraints (albeit in a more regular and grid-constrained fashion than mechanical parts in machines). A unique challenge in machine design, however, is its dependence on diverse long-horizon behaviors, both autonomous and non-autonomous, within an environment. Specifically, a machine may behave differently when operated in different ways (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, a bicycle when pedaled versus when braking) or under different external conditions (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, driving a car in sunny versus rainy weather). Similarly, many sophisticated machines cannot function without appropriate control policies, as exemplified by aircraft that rely on fly-by-wire systems to stabilize their inherently unstable aerodynamic configurations (which would otherwise be unflyable by a human pilot alone). A key open problem is therefore how to account for the interplay among physics, control policy, and compositional structure in machine design.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, unlike in math theorem proving where one valid proof often suffices (even though multiple proofs may still be valued), design domains typically require generating a diverse set of candidate solutions. This diversity is essential to (i) differentiate products, (ii) adapt to unpredictable market demands, and (iii) account for uncertainty in real-world testing and deployment. Consequently, the task places greater emphasis on diversity, and a model for compositional machine design should function more like a generative model than a simple reward maximizer.</p>

<p spacebefore='-5.69054pt'/>
<p>Studying the full problem of compositional machine design is challenging, as it involves the coupling of many interacting factors.
We therefore focus on a minimalist, component-level setting in which machines are constructed primarily from cuboid primitives with clear functional semantics, together with a small set of specialized exceptions, and operate under a shared control policy in an environment governed by rigid-body and elastic mechanics. This abstraction allows us to properly benchmark the capabilities of existing LLMs and to assess the upper bounds, potential, and challenges of agentic systems and RL algorithms.</p>
<p>To this end, we create <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, an interactive environment adapted from the machine-building game Besiege, in which players design medieval machines to complete tasks such as destroying castles.
Powered by the built-in physics engine, <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> supports physical simulation of mechanical systems such as vehicles and catapults in user-customized environments with terrains, obstacles, external forces (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, wind and gravity), and co-existing agents. The environment provides nearly 80 types of building blocks (examples illustrated in Fig. <ref target='uid29'/>), including passive ones like drills and logs, and powered ones like powered cogs and wheels.
Machines are constructed by sequentially attaching new parts to vacant and attachable faces of existing blocks, starting from a root block and thus forming a “construction tree” (indeed a directly acyclic graph (DAG), in the sense of operation orders; one block can has two parents in the DAG; the actual structures may contain loops).
Powered blocks can receive control commands, allowing machines to be operated precisely. During simulation, complete state information (e.g., the position and velocity of each block in the constructed machine) can be recorded for model feedback. Finally, the environment supports custom modifications and can be extended with additional block types and richer physics (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, simple fluid simulation). Further details are explained in Appendix <ref target='cid10'/>.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> is unique in balancing real-world geometry and physics, part-level semantics, and simple compositional rules. Block-stacking environments like LEGO <cit><ref target='bid2'/></cit> and Minecraft <cit><ref target='bid2'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid3'/></cit> allow intuitive combinatorial assembly but do not natively provide realistic physical simulation and rely on generic blocks with limited semantic meaning. CAD modeling <cit><ref target='bid4'/></cit> captures fine-grained geometry and interactions, but its complexity makes rules cumbersome and sequences prohibitively long. By contrast, <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> uses semantically meaningful parts with cuboid-like construction rules—supporting realistic physics while remaining abstract enough for tractable composition. This calibrated balance enables the study of compositional creativity and geometric reasoning at a level of difficulty that both differentiates algorithms and permits rapid experimentation. Moreover, unlike prior environments, <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> supports machine destruction, adding durability and failure analysis to the design space.</p>

<p spacebefore='-4.2679pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Representative target machines and tasks.</hi> To benchmark and characterize the performance of different LLMs for agentic compositional machine design, we consider two conceptually simple yet representative target machines to build: <hi rend='it'>car</hi> and <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi> as shown in Fig. <ref target='uid8'/>. While success in both requires understanding part semantics and structural syntax, <hi rend='it'>car</hi> building primarily tests static relational reasoning, such as enforcing correct part orientations, symmetry, and stability; in contrast, <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi> building challenges models with dynamic relational reasoning, where parts must coordinate over time to produce causal mechanical effects. Moreover, the two tasks are simple enough to be constructed with only a few blocks so that they fit within the LLM’s context window, yet complex enough to require explicit reasoning about construction strategies and causal dependencies. We evaluate the performance of <hi rend='it'>cars</hi> and <hi rend='it'>catapults</hi> by their moving distance and their throwing distance (<hi rend='it'>i.e.</hi>, the moving distance of the stone), respectively, towards a fixed and given direction. During each simulation, the generated machine will be placed at a designated position, and the active parts will be powered after a few seconds. As there can be reward hacking issues, for <hi rend='it'>catapults</hi> experiments we surround the designated machine placement position with moderate-height walls. More details about the target machines, rewards, and environments can be found in Appendix <ref target='cid10'/>.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>Machine representations.</hi> In <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, the default XML representation records all blocks with global 3D positions and uses a built-in algorithm to recover connections. Such a representation, however, does not well encode machine structures. Instead, we propose a parsimonious representation aligned with the game’s building logic, based on pairwise relative attachment relationships (i.e., how one part is rotated and attached to another). Details are explained in Appendix <ref target='uid78'/>.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>Performance metrics.</hi> We evaluate our agentic systems using the following quantitative metrics: 1) <hi rend='it'>file validity rate</hi>, the proportion of generated JSON files that can be successfully parsed into machine construction trees; 2) <hi rend='it'>spatial validity rate</hi>, the proportion of generated machines that are free from self-collisions; 3) <hi rend='it'>machine validity rate</hi>, the proportion of machines that satisfy both file and spatial validity; 4) <hi rend='it'>mean and maximum simulation scores</hi>, the average and highest rewards achieved by generated machines in the environment.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Environment feedback.</hi> For the simple target machines <hi rend='it'>car</hi> and <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi>, we consider environment feedback within a time window of 5 seconds that is long enough to characterize their designated functionalities. Specifically, for <hi rend='it'>car</hi> we consider maximum speed and driving distance; for <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi>, we consider boulder throwing distance and maximum height. We also record the machines' global orientation and broken parts information (if any). Details are elaborated in Appendix <ref target='uid80'/>.</p>

<div1 id-text='4.2' id='uid12'><head>Agentic Workflow Design</head>
<p spacebefore='-3.55658pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Single-agent setting.</hi> We first benchmark if a single LLM agent alone is capable of completing the task. Specifically, one LLM agent is provided with the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, moving an object forward). The agent generates a chain-of-thought (CoT; <cit><ref target='bid5'/></cit>) to reason about what is needed and why, and then derives an abstract plan (e.g., connecting a lever to a container with a boulder). This plan is later translated into the construction tree representation.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Iterative editing.</hi> Because compositional machine design requires both low-level spatial reasoning and high-level ideation, a single agent rarely produces satisfactory machines. We therefore also design an iterative editing workflow that involves three major agents: 1) <hi rend='it'>designer</hi>, which produces an initial plan from the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements; 2) <hi rend='it'>refiner</hi>, a self-critic agent that which evaluates a draft against requirements and constraints and proposes multiple candidate revisions at each step; 3) <hi rend='it'>environment querier</hi>, an agent that runs machine simulation and summarizes the environment feedback, in the way that it always provides global information such as machine orientation throughout the trajectory but selectively reports the feedback on specific blocks (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, position and speed) for further machine refinement. The workflow begins with a draft from the designer that is later critiqued by an <hi rend='it'>inspector</hi>, which assess the designed machine in an abstract fashion, then polished once by a refiner. The design then undergoes a fixed number of iterations, each consisting of one querier and one refiner step. At refiner stages, multiple candidates are generated for running Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS; <cit><ref target='bid6'/></cit>). The best design found in this search process is selected as output.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>Hierarchical construction.</hi> Inspired by typical human design processes as well as recent designs of agentic systems <cit><ref target='bid7'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid8'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid9'/></cit>, we introduce a meta-designer agent that first analyzes the requirements and constraints, and then constructs a high-level blueprint of the major functional blocks (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, the suspension system) and their interconnections. With this blueprint in place, we adopt an autoregressive strategy to build the machine block by block: 1) we begin with the first functional block and dispatch the job to eight parallel builder agents; 2) the valid designs from this stage are evenly distributed to another eight builder agents to construct the second block; and 3) the process iterates in this manner until the entire machine is assembled. Empirically, we find that the meta-designer typically decomposes a machine into three to four functional blocks.</p>

<p spacebefore='-2.84526pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>General observations.</hi>
We find compositional machine design to be a challenging task for LLMs (Fig. <ref target='uid14'/> and Table <ref target='uid15'/>), though not intractable: Gemini 2.5 Pro can consistently construct visually sensible machines with non-trivial performance. We find no evidence that reasoning models outperform non-reasoning ones, suggesting the main bottleneck lies in LLMs’ limited 3D understanding and/or in-context learning. We also find that LLMs, especially reasoning models, still exhibit some spatial and physical reasoning as exemplified by the CoT from Gemini Pro 2.5 (Fig. <ref target='uid10'/>), much like a world model in text space.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Failure patterns.</hi> We identified common failure patterns in LLM-generated machines (Fig. <ref target='uid89'/>): 1) <hi rend='it'>incorrect part orientations</hi>; 2) <hi rend='it'>incorrect part placements</hi>, where parts attach to wrong parents; 3) <hi rend='it'>instruction-following failures</hi>, where elements of the high-level blueprint are not strictly observed; 4) <hi rend='it'>flawed high-level reasoning</hi>, where LLMs fail to recognize correct physics or essential components.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Effect of environment feedback.</hi> It is unsurprising that with the more environment feedback the agents receive, the better performance of generated machines improve in general (Table <ref target='uid101'/>).</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Effect of edit history.</hi> We find that edit histories are generally helpful in decreasing the number of failure attempts in creating valid machines (Table  <ref target='uid24'/>), which underscores the importance of longer context window of base models for efficient exploration.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Hierarchical design.</hi> We observe the mean performance improves with hierarchical design only when the abstract-level reasoning on blueprints is reliable, as shown by the performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro. In the meantime, consistent with the intuition that hierarchical design is more structured and principled, it generally yields lower variance in obtained scores.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Effect of CoT reasoning.</hi> As shown in Fig. <ref target='uid89'/>, LLMs often fail to faithfully translate high-level machine design plans in their CoT into semantically and geometrically consistent machine construction trees. To better assess the impact of CoT reasoning on high-level design, we feed the CoT generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro (the best-performing model) to other LLMs, prompting them to directly output construction trees. The resulting machines generally show improved performance (Fig. <ref target='uid112'/>) and highlight the critical role of high-level semantic reasoning in machine design.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>CoT-machine correspondence.</hi> Though the CoT often provides a reasonably high-level blueprint, agents may still generate machines that deviate from the intended structure (Fig. <ref target='uid89'/>). We hypothesize that this misalignment is a key reason many LLMs struggle to build better machines.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Machine representation.</hi> We experiment with a coordinate-only representation derived from the default XML (Appendix <ref target='uid76'/>) and our construction tree representation. Results show that the coordinate-only representation performs significantly worse (Table <ref target='uid25'/>), implying that explicit structural information is necessary for LLM understanding.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>3D information.</hi>
We observe that (Table <ref target='uid23'/>) the performance generally improves when we also feed parsed 3D information into the context of LLMs, which implies that LLMs are less capable of understanding relative spatial relationship (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, construction trees).</p>

<p>Although agentic systems show promise in compositional machine design, simply scaling system size is unlikely to be economical, as errors compound rapidly.

We thus explore reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> to develop machine-design capabilities.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>Cold-start finetuning and dataset curation.</hi> Following recent RLVR practices <cit><ref target='bid10'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid11'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid12'/></cit>, we curated a small dataset to cold-start LLMs by aligning their reasoning process with expert CoT. Specifically, we collected textual descriptions of machine functionalities from Besiege player communities and prompted Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate corresponding machines. After filtering out invalid generations, we obtained 9,984 valid machine–CoT pairs. We then used this dataset to perform supervised finetuning on Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct for 12 epochs. Additional training details are provided in Appendix <ref target='uid96'/>.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>RL finetuning settings.</hi>
We finetune agents specialized in building a single type of machine (either <hi rend='it'>car</hi> or <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi>), making our setup closely aligned with one-shot RLVR <cit><ref target='bid13'/></cit> where a single prompt is used throughout the RL process. We adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO; <cit><ref target='bid14'/></cit>) with LoRA parametrization <cit><ref target='bid15'/></cit> (rank 64) and mixed-precision training to finetune the cold-started model. We evaluate both the standard GRPO advantage estimator and the pass@k variant <cit><ref target='bid16'/></cit>. In the latter case, due to the implementation of the RLVR framework verl <cit><ref target='bid17'/></cit>, the number of rollouts is set equal to <formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mi>k</mi></math><texmath>k</texmath></formula>. Each experiment is run for 400 iterations on 8 A100 GPUs with per-GPU batch size of 1 and gradient accumulation of 8. We apply KL regularization with strength 0.001 to encourage the model to remain close to its initialization.</p>

<p spacebefore='-2.84526pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>General results.</hi> As shown in Fig. <ref target='uid104'/>, RL finetuning can generally improve the mean performance, mostly by increasing the percentage that machines are valid (including file validity, machine validity and satisfaction of minimum performance threshold). In the meantime, we also find that the maximum reward increases in our best setting. Similar to observations in many other RLVR settings, the entropy of the output distribution quickly drops even with regularization.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Pass@k advantage vs. Pass@1 advantage.</hi>
Since we eventually care about the best performing designs, especially given the low validity rate, our default setting adopts Pass@k advantage estimator. Indeed, Pass@k finetuning is more likely to discovery promising machine designs (Fig. <ref target='uid102'/>).</p>

font=footnotesize</unexpected></figure>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Evolution of generated machines during finetuning.</hi> In Fig. <ref target='uid20'/>, we qualitatively examine how models refine their designs over the course of finetuning. We observe that models typically make detail-level adjustments, such as shifting part positions, while keeping the same high-level design strategy rather than exploring alternative strategies. Although these strategies are often reasonable, the models struggle to find precise configurations that enable smooth coordination among parts. This precision is especially critical for sophisticated mechanisms like catapults to function properly.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Cold-start.</hi>
Not surprisingly, we find that cold-start alone does not enable models to produce satisfactory designs, and that finetuning on the cold-start model is better than on the base model (Table <ref target='uid18'/>).</p>

<div0 id-text='6' id='cid6'><head>Discussions and Intriguing Insights</head>
<p spacebefore='-4.2679pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Capabilities for compositional machine design.</hi> Although tasks such as visual understanding and generation also depend on spatial, physical, and semantic reasoning, compositional machine design introduces unique requirements for LLM capabilities. Without precise spatial placement of machine parts, a design may fail to function correctly; a gear train, for example, will not transmit rotation if the gears are misaligned. Since the design process is typically hierarchical, successful LLMs must be able to accurately translate high-level blueprints into detailed geometric designs. In addition, machine design spans both concept-level reasoning and detailed specification. This dual demand often leads to large design documents and calls for a form of “visual reasoning” expressed through text, similar to what has been studied in LLMs applied to scalable vector graphics (SVG) and CAD models <cit><ref target='bid18'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid19'/></cit>. Multimodal reasoning is also important because effective machine design typically relies on integrating textual descriptions with visual or schematic representations. In this work, however, we focus only on pure LLM-based reasoning to isolate and analyze its capabilities for compositional machine design.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Challenges in agentic machine design systems.</hi> The task of machine design faces similar challenges found in agentic systems in domains such as legal services and other knowledge-intensive fields. A key difficulty is the highly varied requirements and domain knowledge of different customers. To address this, LLMs need to acquire task-specific knowledge through in-context learning or finetuning. In addition, the complexity of design tasks often requires multiple agents to coordinate, and such pipelines can suffer error accumulation when the base LLM lacks sufficient capability.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Exploration in machine design space.</hi> Different from tasks such as theorem proving, the goal of compositional machine design is to discover structures that more effectively achieve desired functionalities. Rather than reusing existing solutions, a practical design agent should be able to propose novel strategies, structural layouts, and part specifications as machine complexity increases. Meeting this requirement calls for RL finetuning methods that prevent models from collapsing into a narrow set of strategies and structures, which recent methods aim to alleviate <cit><ref target='bid20'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid21'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid22'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid23'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid24'/></cit>. This demand is closely related to continual RL <cit><ref target='bid25'/></cit>, since finetuned LLMs must avoid catastrophic forgetting, maintain its reasoning ability, and consolidate learned strategies, which is particularly important because large-scale machine design datasets are rare and commercially infeasible to collect.</p>

<p spacebefore='-2.84526pt'/>
<p><hi rend='bold'>3D graphics codes for generative modeling.</hi> There is a long history in 3D asset generation and engineering design of representing the construction of a target instance as a program or sequence of operations in a domain-specific language <cit><ref target='bid26'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid27'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid28'/></cit>, which we refer to here as 3D graphics codes <cit><ref target='bid18'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid29'/></cit>. Unlike geometric representations such as point clouds or meshes, these codes describe objects at a higher semantic level, capturing part composition, design constraints, and user operations in modeling software.
Similar to programming languages, 3D graphics codes are inherently discrete and are typically generated with autoregressive models trained from scratch <cit><ref target='bid30'/></cit> or with LLMs finetuned on curated datasets <cit><ref target='bid31'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid32'/></cit>. Much of the existing work centers on CAD scripts for individual parts <cit><ref target='bid33'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid19'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid4'/></cit> or Blender macros for single assets <cit><ref target='bid34'/></cit>. Whereas recent studies on LEGO assemblies <cit><ref target='bid3'/></cit>, Minecraft structures <cit><ref target='bid2'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid35'/></cit>, and procedural scene generation <cit><ref target='bid27'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid29'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid36'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid30'/></cit> introduce richer compositionality, they still fall short of the task of compositional machine design, which requires assemblies that both function under physical laws and exhibit the precise geometry of real objects.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>LLM agents.</hi> LLM agents are language models organized to operate in iterative loops of perception and action <cit><ref target='bid37'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid38'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid39'/></cit>. They interact with external tools <cit><ref target='bid40'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid41'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid42'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid43'/></cit>, respond to signals from simulated or real environments <cit><ref target='bid44'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid45'/></cit>, incorporate self-reflection to refine their outputs <cit><ref target='bid46'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid19'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid47'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid48'/></cit>, and are commonly organized into multi-agent systems that coordinate roles and exchange information
 <cit><ref target='bid49'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid50'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid9'/></cit>
. These designs move beyond one-shot text generation and establish LLMs as adaptive decision makers capable of long-horizon reasoning. Approaches that introduce search over possible solutions <cit><ref target='bid51'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid52'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid53'/></cit> or reflection on prior attempts <cit><ref target='bid54'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid55'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid56'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid7'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid48'/></cit> have enabled progress on increasingly complex tasks.
LLM agents have already been used in design tasks such as code synthesis <cit><ref target='bid57'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid58'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid59'/></cit>, CAD design <cit><ref target='bid19'/></cit> and game environments <cit><ref target='bid60'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid2'/></cit>.
Partially inspired by these developments, <cit><ref target='bid61'/></cit> proposed a prototypical agent-based design framework that generates mechanical structures from text prompts. Their system treats structure generation as a one-shot process and delegates the search for optimal geometric and physical parameters to external optimization tools. In contrast, our work with <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> explores how LLM agents can directly and iteratively bridge compositional structures to functional goals, framing design as a process of reasoning and adaptation with both accurate simulation and intuitive physics.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).</hi> Recent studies indicate that, by running RL finetuning with verifiable rewards from simulators or verifiers, reasoning abilities emerge <cit><ref target='bid14'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid62'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid63'/></cit>, even when single prompt is used during finetuning <cit><ref target='bid13'/></cit>.
Yet, many methods exhibit loss of diversity as output entropy collapses during reinforcement learning and thus do not fully enable LLMs to explore novel solutions. Examples of mitigation methods include explicit entropy or KL regularization <cit><ref target='bid22'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid64'/></cit>, Pass@k training <cit><ref target='bid16'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid21'/></cit>, and distribution-matching objectives like generative flow networks <cit><ref target='bid20'/></cit>, <cit><ref target='bid65'/></cit>.
<hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> provides verifiable rewards and thus enables direct application of RLVR to compositional machine design.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Concluding remarks</hi>. We introduced <hi rend='it'>compositional machine design</hi>, a simplified yet challenging task that reflects core aspects of real-world machine design. To evaluate LLM performance on this task, we developed <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>, an interactive environment based on the game Besiege. Our results with agentic systems and reinforcement learning demonstrate that LLMs hold promise for solving this problem. While we did not exhaustively explore all designs or integrate multi-modal information, our findings underscore the need to advance fundamental LLM algorithms and capabilities, and point toward exciting future directions in machine design.</p>

<div0 id-text='B' id='cid10'><head>Details on the <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> Environment</head>
<p>We built <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> by creating plug-in modules for the game Besiege that create interfaces to allow flexible composition of parts (once certain rules are obeyed), control policies on multiple powered parts (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>. powered cogs), recording of state information of any block (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, position, orientation, part integrity, etc.) and settings of termination conditions (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, some part passing through a line). <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> supports multi-process launching and thus allows for efficient parallel RL training. As the game natively supports multi-player gameplay, <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> can naturally be applied to multi-agent RL settings. As the game Besiege (shown in Fig. <ref target='uid28'/>) is built with the (mostly) open-sourced Unity3D game engine<note id-text='2' id='uid26' place='foot'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)</note>, <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> is highly-customizable: the environment 1) natively supports modification of physical parameters, external forces, terrains and obstacles (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, stone buildings) and 2) allows for extension patches (known as mods<note id-text='3' id='uid27' place='foot'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding</note>) to introduce other mechanisms, such as new block types, fluid simulation and many other components.</p>

</float>
<div1 id-text='B.1' id='uid30'><head>Construction Rule</head>
<p>Each machine is built by attaching new blocks to the existing structure, starting from a special root block. For convenience, we describe each construction step as an “attacher” block (child) connected to an “attachee” block (parent). As an attacher, each block has exactly one face available for connection; as an attachee, each block has none to several attachable faces. Once a face is used, it is considered occupied and cannot be reused. If, after construction, the free end of a block happens to coincide with an attachable face of an existing block, the two blocks are automatically connected.</p>
<p>A few special blocks violate the rule described above, such as spring. These blocks have two ends and thus must have two parent blocks, do not have physical volume can be attached to either vacant or occupied faces of other blocks.</p>
<p>Finally, each block can be rescaled and rotated after construction. Since post-construction scaling and rotation introduce unnecessary complexity into our pipeline, we exclude them from our experiments and leave their handling to future work.</p>
</div1>
<div1 id-text='B.2' id='uid31'><head>Simulation</head>
<p>Once constructed, the machine will be placed at the designated pose indicated by the position and orientation of the starting block (not necessary near the ground, but there is a maximum height constraint). The machine will be subject to gravity and Newtonian physical laws (rigid and elastic ones) after placement.</p>
</div1>
<div1 id-text='B.3' id='uid32'><head>Blocks</head>
<p>Out of the 75 construction blocks provided by Besiege, we filter out a list of 27 blocks (shown in Fig. <ref target='uid29'/>) that are most relevant to build machines with classical mechanical mechanisms such as levers and trusses.</p>

<item id-text='1' id='uid61'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Movement.</hi>

</item>
<item id-text='2' id='uid62'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Throw.</hi>
Referred to as the <hi rend='it'>catapult</hi> task in the main text, the goal is to construct a machine that can launch boulders over long distances. To prevent unintended strategies (e.g., carrying the boulder instead of throwing it, or letting it roll along the ground), the building area is enclosed by a medium-height wall.</p>
</item>
<item id-text='3' id='uid63'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Delivery.</hi>
This task requires building a machine that can transport a large stone forward across different terrains (Fig. <ref target='uid70'/>).</p>
</item>
<item id-text='4' id='uid64'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Pick.</hi>
The objective here is to design a machine that can retrieve a stone located at the bottom of a deep well (Fig. <ref target='uid69'/>).</p>
</item></list>
<p>For many of these tasks, we introduce multiple difficulty levels (not used in the experiments reported in this paper) to encourage progressively more sophisticated designs:</p>
<list type='simple'>
<item id-text='1' id='uid65'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Movement and Delivery.</hi>
We consider: (1) randomized terrains with stones and wooden rods (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, Fig. <ref target='uid67'/>), (2) curved tracks (Fig. <ref target='uid72'/>), and (3) obstacles such as height-limiting bars.</p>
</item>
<item id-text='2' id='uid66'><p noindent='true'><hi rend='bold'>Throw.</hi>
We design: (1) varied objectives, such as requiring the boulder to pass through an aerial ring (Fig. <ref target='uid71'/>) or land precisely within a small target zone, (2) environmental factors such as wind, and (3) obstacles, including height restrictions either within the building area or along the boulder’s trajectory.</p>

<div0 id-text='C' id='cid11'><head>Search Strategies in Machine Modification Loops</head>
<p>Apart from the MCTS strategy used in the main experiments, we also evaluate two alternatives: (i) best-of-N, where we select the best-performing machine out of N candidates, and (ii) random search, which mimics best-of-N but instead selects a random candidate. For clarity, we refer to one consecutive “querier–refiner” call as a search node (consistent with our MCTS setup). Unlike classical MCTS or best-of-N, here each search node is allowed up to five retries to prevent child statistics from being too sparse. We perform <formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mi>R</mi></math><texmath>R</texmath></formula> search rounds, each aiming to obtain 5 valid candidate machines (though this may fail; if fewer than 5 are found, the parent node’s machine is used as a candidate). Full algorithmic details are provided in Algorithm <ref target='cid11'/>, Algorithm <ref target='cid11'/>, and Algorithm <ref target='cid11'/>. In Fig. <ref target='uid74'/> we show the improvement of machine performance with respect to the number of search rounds used. In Fig. <ref target='uid75'/> we compare the efficiency of different search methods in our agentic compositional machine design setting.</p>

<div0 id-text='D' id='cid12'><head>Environment Settings for Agentic Design and RL Finetuning</head>
<div1 id-text='D.1' id='uid76'><head>Machine Representation</head>
<p>To reduce complexity in compositional machine design, our machine representation assumes all blocks remain at their default scale and are not further rotated after attachment (note: the attachment operation itself may rotate blocks).</p>
</div1>
<div1 id-text='D.2' id='uid77'><head>Global Position-based Representation</head>
<p>By simplifying the default XML representation that <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> receives, we obtain the global position-based representation. Below is a concrete example:</p>
<listing breaklines='true' basicstyle=''><p><hi rend='small'><hi frame='single' rend='tt'>0pt0ptfullflexibletrue</hi></hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>[</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {"type": 0, "Position": [0,0,  0], "Rotation": [0,0,0,1]},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {"type": 1, "Position": [0,0,0.5], "Rotation": [0,0,0,1]},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {"type": 2, "Position": [0,0,2.5], "Rotation": [0,0,0,1]},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {"type": 9, "Position": [0,0.5,2], "Rotation": [-<zws/>0.707,0,0,0.707],</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>                "end-<zws/>position": [0,2,0]}</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>]</hi></p>
</listing><p>Basically, each block in the machine is independently recorded without mentioning its adjacent blocks. For most of the block types, only the block type and its pose (position + orientation) are recorded. For special blocks that have two parents, the other end has to be specified, for which the corresponding dictionary has an additional entry of “end-position”.</p>
</div1>
<div1 id-text='D.3' id='uid78'><head>Construction Tree Representation</head>
<p>With our parsimonious construction tree representation, the example machine above is represented by the following the following JSON list:</p>
<listing breaklines='true' basicstyle=''><p><hi rend='small'><hi frame='single' rend='tt'>0pt0ptfullflexibletrue</hi></hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>[</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {'<zws/>type'<zws/>: 0, '<zws/>id'<zws/>: 0, '<zws/>parent'<zws/>  : -<zws/>1, '<zws/>face_id'<zws/>  : -<zws/>1},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {'<zws/>type'<zws/>: 1, '<zws/>id'<zws/>: 1, '<zws/>parent'<zws/>  :  0, '<zws/>face_id'<zws/>  :  0},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {'<zws/>type'<zws/>: 2, '<zws/>id'<zws/>: 2, '<zws/>parent'<zws/>  :  1, '<zws/>face_id'<zws/>  :  0},</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    {'<zws/>type'<zws/>: 9, '<zws/>id'<zws/>: 3, '<zws/>parent_a'<zws/>:  0, '<zws/>face_id_a'<zws/>:  4,</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>                         '<zws/>parent_b'<zws/>:  1, '<zws/>face_id_b'<zws/>:  6}</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>]</hi></p>
</listing><p>Specifically, the ordered list of dictionaries of the machine construction JSON file represents the construction order of blocks. Each dictionary contains the following information of corresponding block: 1) “type”: block type; 2) “id”: the order ID of this block (the same as the order in the list), included so that LLMs do not have to parse it by itself; 3) “parent”, the ID of its parent block; 4) “face_id”, the face of the block's parent to which the block is attached. In cases that the block has two parents (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, a string that connects both parts), we use “parent_a” and “parent_b” to record both parents; similar for “face_id”.</p>
<p>Note: the first block with “id” 0 is always the unique starting block, of which the local position and rotation are always zero.</p>

</div1>
<div1 id-text='D.5' id='uid80'><head>Environment Feedback</head>
<p>In principle, we are able to obtain all state variables of each single part of a simulated machine. Due to the space complexity of the simulation results, not all information can be fed to LLM agents. Here we consider a minimal set of environment feedback information that the environment querier always gathers and returns to the refiner. Below are the minimal set of feedback information for each task:</p>
<p><hi rend='it'>Car.</hi> 1) machine orientation; 2) machine maximum moving distance (towards a designated direction); 3) machine max speed; 4) machine average speed per second; 5) machine position per 0.2 second (atomic time).</p>
<p><hi rend='it'>Catapult.</hi> 1) boulder maximum distance (horizontal, towards a designated distance); 2) boulder maximum height; 3) boulder position per 0.2 second (atomic time).</p>
<p>Beyond these basic pieces of feedback, the querier, after seeing the candidate machine and its simulation results, in our default setting selectively extract a subset of environment feedback given its speculation on the issues of the simulated machine. For instance, parts during simulation may collide with each other and break. Such behavior carries important hints on why machines fail, and an LLM agent with sufficient capability in spatial and physics understanding can possibly identify the vulnerable blocks in the design.</p>

<div1 id-text='E.1' id='uid88'><head>Failure Patterns</head>
<p>Generated machines often fail in systematic ways. As shown in Fig. <ref target='uid89'/>, we observe several recurring categories of errors, including flawed reasoning, structural attachment errors, incorrect part orientations and failures in instruction following. These diverse failure types highlight both the reasoning and execution challenges inherent in compositional machine design.</p>

<div1 id-text='E.2' id='uid90'><head>Need for Precision</head>
<p>In Fig. <ref target='uid91'/> we present a simple example to illustrate how the task of compositional machine design requires high precision in the spatial design of configurations of different parts. Even though the high-level design is feasible, the machine in the top row fails to throw the boulder out due to the incorrect position of the container.</p>

<div1 id-text='E.3' id='uid92'><head>Appearance vs. Performance</head>
<p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref target='uid93'/>, a machine's appearance does not necessarily reflect its actual performance. A design that seems well-aligned with human intuition can fail dramatically, while one that looks awkward or unintuitive may achieve superior results. For LLMs to design machines that are both effective and visually intuitive to humans, reward functions must account not only for task performance but also for stability and other factors that shape human perception of functionality.</p>

<p>Noticing that Gemini 2.5 Pro produces the most satisfactory machines with reasonable CoT, we adopt the single-agent generation setting and collect Gemini-generated machines along with their CoT. We curated 100 design objectives: 75 captions of machines created by Besiege players from the Internet and 25 authored by us. These 25 prompts are constructed by 1) first writing down simple design objectives that are realizable by <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi> and can emerge from some simple rewards, and 2) then introducing environment constraints and machine-specific requirements. Using this prompt dataset, we generate 250 machines per prompt, and after filtering out inappropriate ones (those that fail to parse, cannot be built in the environment, or do not have a specific physics-driven functionality, <hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, a statue), we obtain 9,984 machines with their corresponding CoT. A sample gallery is shown in Fig. <ref target='uid95'/>.</p>

<p>In our experiment, we use Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as the base model and train it on the Gemini synthesized dataset.

<div1 id-text='F.3' id='uid97'><head>RL Experiment Details</head>
<p>We use verl framework to implement our RL experiments. The LLM is finetuned from Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (with LoRA of rank 64 on all linear layers) using the Gemini-synthesized dataset described above. We set learning rate to 5e-6 with gradient clipping threshold set to 0.5. The GRPO advantage estimator uses an advantage clipping ratio of 0.2. We add a KL penalty (weight 0.001) with respect to the pretrained LLM and do not introduce any entropy regularization. For rollouts, we use a temperature of <formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math><texmath>1.0</texmath></formula> and top-<formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mi>p</mi></math><texmath>p</texmath></formula> value of 0.95.

<p><hi rend='bold'>Meta-Designer in hierarchical design.</hi> In Table <ref target='uid98'/>, we show that how a meta-designer for hierarchical design may benefit compositional machine design. Leveraging the knowledge on existing machines, meta-designers can identify the key macro-level mechanical components that are easier to design compared to the whole task, as shown in the results for Gemini 2.5 Pro, Kimi K2 and Llama 4 Scout. However, introducing an additional stage can introduce compounding error and, if the LLM agent is not capable of integrating different macro-level mechanical components, they may lead to lower scores, which we hypothesize is the reason for the failure of hierarchical design in models like Qwen3. Moreover, we examine if the meta-designer should provide step-by-step building instruction for the designer (Fig. <ref target='uid99'/>), or simply provide high-level mechanical component descriptions. We find that a meta-designer that provides more detailed information is beneficial mostly when the base model is powerful enough (<hi rend='it'>e.g.</hi>, Gemini 2.5 Pro).</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Effect of feedback-free self-critic.</hi> In Table <ref target='uid100'/>, we show that the inspector agent which does self-critic before running any environment simulation tend to improve performance for models like Gemini 2.5 Pro (the most powerful model for the task of compositional machine design in <hi rend='bold'>BesiegeField</hi>) but can fail drastically for models like o3.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Effect of active feedback queries.</hi> In Table <ref target='uid101'/>, we show that the active queries on the environment feedbacks help most of the models achieve better performance, compared to the setting with no environment feedback and that with only environment simulation final scores.</p>
<p><hi rend='bold'>Additional RL results.</hi> In Fig. <ref target='uid102'/> and <ref target='uid104'/> and , we show the maximum scores achieved in the environments with different RL methods plus the validity rate of machines. We visualize the maximum score since, in the case when one is allowed to use inference-time scaling techniques, the best performing machines are the ones people care most about. We show that our settings with Pass@64 training achieves the best maximum score with two different random seeds. In additiona, in Fig. <ref target='uid106'/>, we visualize the corresponding Best@N metrics.</p>
<p>For completeness, we also visualize the results with our default setting on the task <hi rend='it'>car</hi> in Fig. <ref target='uid103'/>, <ref target='uid105'/> and <ref target='uid107'/>.</p>

Removing the environment querier causes a slight drop in average machine performance. With reward signals only, the performance markedly degrades across most LLMs.</hi></caption></p>

<p>To further investigate if high-level machine blueprint or low-level part placement is more important,
we experiment with machine generation of LLMs by generating machine details conditioned on Gemini-generated CoT (instead of on CoT produced by themselves).
We find that with Gemini CoT, almost all LLMs design machines that are more visually similar to "catapults", as shown in Fig. <ref target='uid112'/>. We therefore hypothesize that the major gap between other LLMs, especially open-source ones, and Gemini 2.5 Pro is the abstract-level spatial and physics reasoning on machine designs.</p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>1.  **Dynamic Blocks Analysis:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    The only dynamic block in this machine is the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> [10].</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Position and Orientation**: The `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> [10] is located at center coordinates [1.0, 2.0, -<zws/>2.0] with a global orientation of '<zws/>x-<zws/>'<zws/>.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Analysis**:</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>        a. **Impact on the machine**: The `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> [10] serves as the pivot for the throwing arm. It is the core component intended to generate the throwing motion.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>        b. **Direction of force**: The block is oriented along the '<zws/>x-<zws/>'<zws/> axis, meaning its rotation axis is the global x-<zws/>axis. When activated, it will generate a torque, causing its sub-<zws/>blocks to rotate in the y-<zws/>z plane.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>        c. **Impact on sub-<zws/>blocks and machine**: The `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> [10] will cause its child blocks ([11], [12], [13]) to swing upwards and forwards in a powerful arc. Simultaneously, it will exert an equal and opposite reaction torque on its parent block [8] and the entire support structure, which will likely cause the machine to violently tip over or break.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    The special static blocks are the `<zws/>Container`<zws/> [12] and the `<zws/>Boulder`<zws/> [13].</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Container [12]**: It is located at the end of the throwing arm (`<zws/>Log`<zws/> [11]) with its center at [1.0, 6.9, -<zws/>2.0]. Its orientation is '<zws/>y+'<zws/> (upwards). This placement and orientation are rational, as it correctly positions it to hold the `<zws/>Boulder`<zws/> [13] like a cup at the end of the throwing arm.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Boulder [13]**: It is placed inside the `<zws/>Container`<zws/> [12] with its center at [1.0, 7.4, -<zws/>2.0]. As the projectile, its placement is logical and necessary for the machine'<zws/>s function.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>4.  **Comprehensive Analysis:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    a. **Force Summary**: The primary force is gravity, which makes the top-<zws/>heavy machine highly unstable due to the high position of the `<zws/>Boulder`<zws/> [13]. Upon activation, the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> [10] will generate a massive torque on the throwing arm and an equal reaction torque on the flimsy support tower. The combination of static top-<zws/>heaviness and dynamic reaction forces will lead to immediate structural failure.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**1. Analyze the Task and Machine Design:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Objective:** Build a leverage-<zws/>based machine to throw a boulder for maximum distance and height. This implies a catapult or trebuchet design.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Machine Structure:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Base:** A wide base is constructed using `<zws/>Wooden Block`<zws/>s (ID 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) connected to the `<zws/>Starting Block`<zws/> (ID 0). This seems designed for stability.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Tower:** A vertical tower is built on the right side of the base with `<zws/>Wooden Block`<zws/>s (ID 6, 7, 8). Block 8 is the apex of this support structure.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Lever Arm:** A `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (ID 10) is mounted on top of the tower (on block 8), serving as the fulcrum. A `<zws/>Log`<zws/> (ID 11) acts as the throwing arm, with a `<zws/>Container`<zws/> (ID 12) and `<zws/>Boulder`<zws/> (ID 13) at the top. A `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (ID 14) is attached to the other side of the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> as a counterweight.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Power System:** The machine uses a combination of a powered `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (ID 10) and two `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/>s (ID 15, 16). The rubber bands connect the top of the tower (block 8) to points on the base (blocks 3 and 5).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**2. Analyze the Environmental Feedback:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **`<zws/>machine damaged`<zws/>**: This is the most critical piece of feedback. The machine is breaking during operation.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **`<zws/>machine parts: DoubleWoodenBlock order_id:8`<zws/>**: The failure point is identified as block 8. This is the `<zws/>Wooden Block`<zws/> that supports the entire rotating lever arm assembly.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **`<zws/>occurred at 0.4sec`<zws/>**: The failure is almost instantaneous, indicating a massive, immediate overload on the structure.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Boulder Performance:** The boulder travels a mere 5.63 units and ends up behind its starting Z coordinate. This confirms a catastrophic failure of the launch mechanism, not just a weak throw. The arm is likely collapsing or swinging backward.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**3. Synthesize and Hypothesize the Root Cause:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   The point of failure (block 8) is subjected to several immense forces:</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    1.  **Static Load:** The weight of the entire lever arm assembly (rotating block, log, container, boulder, ballast) rests on it.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    2.  **Dynamic Load:** The torque from the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (ID 10) creates a powerful reaction force on its mount point (block 8).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    3.  **Tension Load:** The two `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/>s (ID 15, 16) are stretched from block 8 down to the base. When the simulation starts, they will contract with immense force, pulling down and forward on block 8.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Hypothesis:** The combination of these forces, particularly the sudden, immense tension from the rubber bands, is causing block 8 to shear off from the rest of the tower (block 7). The tower itself, being a single column of wooden blocks, is structurally weak and cannot withstand this combination of bending and shear stress. The rubber bands are incorrectly placed; instead of powering the lever arm, they are destroying the support structure. The machine is literally tearing itself apart.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**4. Formulate a Plan for Further Investigation:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>To confirm this hypothesis, I need to observe the behavior of the key components involved in the structural failure around the time of the collapse (0.4s).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Block 8 (Failure Point):** I need to see its position and rotation to confirm it'<zws/>s being ripped from its mounting.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Block 10 (Rotating Block/Fulcrum):** Its movement will show the forces being applied by the lever arm onto block 8.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Block 11 (Lever Arm):** Its motion will confirm the direction of the attempted throw and the overall collapse dynamics.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Rubber Bands (15 &amp; 16):** I need to check their `<zws/>length`<zws/> property. A rapid decrease in length will prove they are contracting and applying the destructive force I suspect.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>Based on this analysis, I will request detailed feedback on these specific components to verify the cause of the failure.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>The user wants me to fix a trebuchet-<zws/>like machine that is failing.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**1. Analysis of the Machine and Failure:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Machine Structure:** The machine consists of a base, a vertical tower on the right side, and a rotating arm mounted on top of the tower. The arm has a container with a boulder on one end and was intended to have a counterweight on the other. Power is provided by a `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (ID 10) at the pivot and a `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (ID 14) acting as a counterweight. Two `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/>s (ID 15, 16) are connected from the top of the tower (ID 8) to the base, seemingly for stabilization.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Failure Mode:** The simulation feedback consistently reports that `<zws/>DoubleWoodenBlock id:8`<zws/> is damaged at 0.4 seconds. Block 8 is the top-<zws/>most block of the support tower, directly holding the entire rotating assembly (`<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/>, arm, boulder, and ballast).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Root Cause Analysis:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Overwhelming Force:** The combination of the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/>'<zws/>s torque and the heavy `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (ID 14, mass 3) dropping creates an immense rotational force. The `<zws/>Boulder`<zws/> (ID 13, mass 5) at the end of a long lever arm (ID 11, `<zws/>Log`<zws/>) amplifies this stress. The tower, constructed from simple `<zws/>Wooden Block`<zws/>s, cannot withstand this force, leading to the failure of block 8.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **Instability:** The feedback shows the entire machine lifting and tilting (`<zws/>machine orientation in long time x-<zws/>`<zws/>, `<zws/>machine frequently changes in the following orientations`<zws/>). This indicates the base is too small and light to counteract the violent motion of the throwing arm. The `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/>s (ID 15, 16) are connected asymmetrically (from the tower to the front and left parts of the base), which likely introduces a twisting force, contributing to the instability and structural failure rather than preventing it.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**2. Modification Strategy:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>The primary goal is to ensure the machine'<zws/>s structural integrity so it can actually launch the boulder without self-<zws/>destructing.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Step 1: Reduce Destructive Forces.** The most critical issue is the excessive force breaking block 8. The simplest way to address this is to remove the primary source of this force, the `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (ID 14). The `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (ID 10) by itself will still provide sufficient power to launch the boulder, but with much less violent acceleration, which the wooden structure should be able to handle.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Step 2: Remove Ineffective Components.** The `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/>s (ID 15 and 16) are not stabilizing the structure effectively and are likely contributing to the twisting failure due to their asymmetric placement. Removing them will simplify the forces acting on the tower and improve stability.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>This plan directly targets the identified points of failure. By removing the ballast and the rubber bands, the stress on the critical component (block 8) is significantly reduced, and the machine'<zws/>s overall stability should improve. The throwing distance might be reduced, but a successful, non-<zws/>destructive launch is the first priority.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>**3. Final Plan:**</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>1.  Remove `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (ID 14).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>2.  Remove `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/> (ID 15).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>3.  Remove `<zws/>Rubber Band`<zws/> (ID 16).</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>This is a minimal but highly effective set of changes to fix the core problem.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>&lt;<zws/>/Thought Process&gt;<zws/></hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>&lt;<zws/>Modification Description&gt;<zws/></hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>The machine'<zws/>s support tower (block 8) is breaking due to excessive torque from the ballast and rotating block. The rubber bands are placed asymmetrically, causing twisting forces and instability. I will remove the ballast (ID 14) to reduce the strain on the structure and remove the two rubber bands (ID 15, 16) to eliminate the destabilizing twisting forces.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>&lt;<zws/>Simulation Prediction After Modification&gt;<zws/></hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Power Blocks Analysis:** The launch will now be powered solely by the `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> (10). The removal of the `<zws/>Ballast`<zws/> (14) significantly reduces the peak torque, resulting in a smoother, less violent rotation of the throwing arm. This will prevent the structural failure of the tower.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Balance Check:** Without the heavy ballast dropping and the asymmetric pull from the rubber bands, the machine will be much more stable during operation. The base should remain mostly on the ground, with minimal tipping as the arm swings. The overall center of gravity will be more manageable.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The primary defect, the destruction of block 8, will be resolved. The machine will successfully complete the launch sequence without breaking. While the throwing distance and height may be lower due to the reduced power, the machine will now be functional and can complete its primary task of throwing the boulder.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **0.0s -<zws/> 0.5s:** The `<zws/>Rotating Block`<zws/> activates, and the arm begins to swing upwards smoothly. The tower (block 8) remains intact.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **0.5s -<zws/> 1.0s:** The arm reaches its maximum rotation, and the boulder is released from the container. The machine'<zws/>s base remains stable on the ground.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>    *   **1.0s -<zws/> 5.0s:** The boulder travels in a clear parabolic arc. The machine settles without any damage. The final throwing distance will be shorter than the broken attempts but will represent a successful launch.</hi></p>

<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>II. Block Introduction:</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>1. Blocks are mainly divided into five major categories: Basic Blocks, Mobility Blocks, Mechanical Blocks, Weapon Blocks, and Armor Blocks.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>-<zws/> Basic Blocks are the fundamental components of many machines -<zws/> structural blocks and some basic moving parts.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>-<zws/> Mobility Blocks are primarily designed for movement functions -<zws/> powered and unpowered wheels, steering blocks, and gears.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>-<zws/> Mechanical Blocks provide various useful auxiliary functions -<zws/> joints, suspension devices, winches, grabbers, etc.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>-<zws/> Weapon Blocks offer various types of violent output at different ranges -<zws/> swords and saws for close combat, and cannons and rockets for long-<zws/>range.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'>-<zws/> Armor Blocks can protect the machine from damage or provide useful shapes for carrying other blocks -<zws/> armor plates and wooden panels, as well as half-<zws/>pipes and brackets.</hi></p>
<p noindent='true'><hi rend='tt'> </hi></p>
