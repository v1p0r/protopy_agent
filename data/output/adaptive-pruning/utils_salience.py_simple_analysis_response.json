The salience scores are fundamental to APT's decision-making process for both pruning unimportant parameters and tuning important ones.\n\n## 1. compute_activation_gradient_product Function\n\n**Purpose**: Calculate the primary component of outlier-aware salience scoring based on activation-gradient magnitude product, compressed across batches.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements Equation (5) from the paper:\n```\n\u015c(W_:j) = \u03a3_(x,y\u2208\ud835\udc9f_t) \u03a3_i |\u2202\u2112/\u2202H_j,i| \u00b7 \u03a3_(x,y\u2208\ud835\udc9f_t) \u03a3_i |H_j,i|\n```\n\n**Implementation Logic**:\n1. Input consists of activations H and their corresponding gradients \u2202L/\u2202H\n2. Sum absolute values of activations across batch and sequence dimensions: `sum(|H|)`\n3. Sum absolute values of gradients across batch and sequence dimensions: `sum(|\u2202L/\u2202H|)`\n4. Compute element-wise product of these two summed tensors\n5. Return the resulting salience score tensor\n\n**Key Design Considerations**:\n- **Memory Efficiency**: By summing across batches before multiplication, we significantly reduce memory consumption compared to storing full gradient tensors\n- **Compression Strategy**: This approach follows the paper's emphasis on \"compressing the activation and gradients by summing along batches before production\"\n- **Batch Processing**: The function should handle mini-batches efficiently, accumulating statistics across multiple forward/backward passes if needed for more stable estimates\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- Handle zero/near-zero activations or gradients to prevent numerical instability\n- Ensure proper dimension alignment between activation and gradient tensors\n- Support different tensor layouts (batch-first vs sequence-first)\n\n## 2. compute_kurtosis Function\n\n**Purpose**: Calculate the kurtosis of activation tensors to capture outlier importance, which is crucial for preserving block outlier parameters that play a crucial role in task-specific capabilities.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation**: Computes the fourth standardized moment (kurtosis) of activation distributions:\n```\nKurt(X) = E[(X - \u03bc)\u2074] / (E[(X - \u03bc)\u00b2])\u00b2\n```\n\n**Implementation Logic**:\n1. For each activation channel/neuron/head, compute its mean (\u03bc) and variance (\u03c3\u00b2)\n2. Calculate the fourth central moment: E[(X - \u03bc)\u2074]\n3. Normalize by the square of variance to get kurtosis\n4. Apply square root as specified in Equation (5): `(Kurt(O_j,:))^(1/2)`\n\n**Key Design Considerations**:\n- **Outlier Detection**: High kurtosis indicates heavy tails in the distribution, signaling the presence of outliers that should be preserved during pruning\n- **Per-Block Calculation**: Compute kurtosis for each parameter block (MHA head, FFN neuron, hidden dimension) separately\n- **Numerical Stability**: Use numerically stable algorithms for moment calculation to avoid overflow/underflow\n- **Efficient Implementation**: Leverage PyTorch's optimized statistical functions when possible\n\n**Connection to Paper**: This directly addresses the concern that \"block outlier parameters play a crucial role in task-specific capabilities\" and prevents their averaging out during block-level salience measurement.\n\n## 3. normalize_scores Function\n\n**Purpose**: Adjust raw salience scores by parameter count to create salience density metrics used in the efficient search algorithm.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements the \"salience density\" concept mentioned in Appendix C:\n```\nSalience Density = Salience Score / Parameter Count\n```\n\n**Implementation Logic**:\n1. Take raw salience scores (combination of activation-gradient product and kurtosis term)\n2. Divide by the number of parameters in each corresponding block\n3. Return normalized scores suitable for comparative ranking\n\n**Key Design Considerations**:\n- **Fair Comparison**: Enables fair comparison between different types of blocks (e.g., MHA heads vs FFN neurons) that have different parameter counts\n- **Binary Search Compatibility**: The normalized scores are used in conjunction with binary search to identify top-salient blocks given sparsity constraints\n- **Parameter Count Accuracy**: Must accurately calculate parameter counts for each block type:\n  - MHA head: 4 \u00d7 d_model \u00d7 d_head (including Q,K,V,O projections)\n  - FFN neuron: 2 \u00d7 d_model (input and output weights)\n  - Hidden dimension: n_layers \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 d_head \u00d7 n_heads + 2 \u00d7 ffn_size)\n\n**Integration with Pruning Algorithm**: These normalized scores are fed into the binary search algorithm described in Section 4.2 to determine which blocks to retain while meeting the sparsity constraint \u03b3_t.\n\n## Overall Module Integration\n\nThe three functions work together to implement the complete outlier-aware salience scoring system:\n\n1. **compute_activation_gradient_product** provides the base importance signal from gradient information\n2. **compute_kurtosis** adds the outlier sensitivity component to preserve important extreme values\n3. **normalize_scores** prepares the combined score for use in the pruning/search algorithm\n\nThese utilities are called by both:\n- **AdaptivePruner**: Uses full outlier-aware salience for pruning decisions\n- **AdaptiveTuner**: Uses standard salience (activation-gradient product) for adapter importance ranking\n\nThe module must be designed for efficiency since it will be called frequently during training, potentially at every step or every few steps depending on the update_frequency parameter in config.yaml.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1764810972, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1140, "prompt_tokens": 38964, "total_tokens": 40104, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}]
