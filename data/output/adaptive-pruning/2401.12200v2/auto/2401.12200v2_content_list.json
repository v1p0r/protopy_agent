Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce APT that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of finetuning, APT dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up to $98 \\%$ task performance when pruning $60 \\%$ of the parameters in RoBERTa and T5 models. APT also preserves $8 6 . 4 \\%$ of LLaMA models’ performance with $70 \\%$ parameters remaining. Furthermore, APT speeds up LMs’ fine-tuning by up to $8 \\times$ and reduces large LMs’ memory training footprint by up to $70 \\%$ Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ROIM1998/APT.

Therefore, we can remove the parameters irrelevant to the fine-tuning task in the early training stage. Early-removing these parameters improves training and inference efficiency while not substantially hurting model accuracy (Frankle et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2023c).

Our ablation study in Section 5.6 indicates the effectiveness of adaptive pruning and tuning.

However, despite reducing LM’s memory consumption, the speedup benefits of quantization require specific framework support, which limits their adaptability. Pruning (LeCun et al., 1989; Han et al., 2016; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Xu et al., 2021) aims to discard unimportant parameters in LMs for inference efficiency. Unstructured pruning (Sanh et al., 2020) prunes sparse parameters in LMs, which requires dedicated hardware support for efficiency improvements. Meanwhile, structured pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021; Xia et al., 2022) prunes consistent blocks in transformer layers (MHA heads, FFN neurons, and model dimensions) for ubiquitous inference efficiency gains. Such pruning often uses knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), which causes more training costs. Post-training pruning (Kwon et al., 2022; Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) aims to prune fine-tuned models with limited extra costs but requires initialization from fully fine-tuned models.

By comparing Table 2 to Table 3, we notice the performance gap in pruned LLaMA models is larger than smaller LMs because we use distillation-free settings in large LM pruning to reduce training memory consumption. One can improve performance-efficiency trade-offs with better memoryefficient distillation, parameter sharing, and re-allocation strategies. Furthermore, because of the hardware features of Ampere-architecture GPUs, layer dimensions divisible by 8 for FP16 and divisible by 16 for Int8 would reach more realistic speedups. One possible direction is to explore a higher level of structured pruning, for example, grouped neurons and dimensions, in LLMs. ",

In large LM pruning, APT maintains $87 \\%$ performance with only $30 \\%$ pruning memory usage when $70 \\%$ LM parameter retained. APT opens new directions to pruning LMs in fine-tuning for resource-limited settings, allowing wider usage of LMs in practical applications.

APT significantly reduces training and inference costs and contributes to lower resource consumption for a wide range of applications. This could have a positive environmental impact but might lead to potential model misuse due to lower resource requirements. Additionally, while APT does not introduce new ethical concerns, it might inherit existing issues in language models, for example, biases in training data. We explicitly ask users of APT to be aware of these risks and follow best practices in data selection and model monitoring to mitigate potential harms. ",

For instruction tuning on the Alpaca dataset, we train the pruned model for 15 epochs after the pre-tuning pruning process to make sure they converge. However, in practice, such training epochs can be reduced. To adaptively increase the tuning parameters in the LM, at the start of fine-tuning, we initialize adapter ranks to 8, with salient layers’ ranks linearly increased. The scaling factors are set as 2 statically. Since evaluating billion-level LLaMA models during instruction tuning with all evaluation tasks would be time-consuming, we did not do the TTA evaluation as small models. We do not conduct any hyper-parameters search for any training for fair comparison. ",

At the same time, under the same pre-tuning pruning settings, APT performs better than the LLMPruner baseline on all four evaluation tasks, indicating the effectiveness of considering outlier parameters in large LM pruning. Nonetheless, the LoRA $^ +$ Prune baseline reaches slightly better results than APT when pruning 13B models, illustrating that there is still room for improving pre-tuning pruning methods in future works. More specifically, among the four tasks we use for evaluating large LMs, TruthfulQA benefits the most from Alpaca fine-tuning. We can see that APT reaches superior results on TruthfulQA than existing baselines regardless of model size. The LM’s capabilities on ARC and HellaSawg downgrade the most when pruning large LM before fine-tuning, implying possibilities of catastrophic forgetting in this paradigm. ",

When training without distillation objectives (w/o self-distillation), the LM performance drops by $1 . 7 \\%$ . Nonetheless, the training is slightly faster with less memory costs. These results present that using distillation objectives for better LM task performance will sacrifice training efficiency as a tradeoff. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the comparisons with existing static knowledge distillation strategies, using the converged full-parameter fine-tuned LM (FT teacher) and LoRA-tuned LM (LoRA teacher) as the teacher model. We calculate the time consumption for both teacher and student training when using these distillation baselines. As shown in Table 10, using fully fine-tuned models as the teacher will incur more memory cost than dense model fine-tuning, while APT only consumes $70 \\%$ . In the meantime, the training convergence speed of APT training is two times faster than the traditional knowledge distillation method with a fine-tuned teacher. Furthermore, using a LoRA-tuned model as the teacher will result in extremely slow training speed. In addition, simply tuning the LoRA layers with knowledge distillation objectives doesn’t help reduce the training memory consumption, as the memory consumption is still $9 6 . 1 \\%$ than full fine-tuning.

As the trajectories shown in Figure 5a, simply enlarging the initial tuning parameter number in APT will not improve or even hurt the model’s final performance. Moreover, the training memory consumption grows even higher than fine-tuning when the tuning layer ranks become extremely large (initial ranks set as 256). Therefore, this result proves that adding tuning parameters according to layer salience is better than uniformly increasing them before tuning. ",

Figure 5b shows the effect of the initial density on LLaMA models’ task performance under the $30 \\%$ sparsity pruning setting. We find that densely-trained models only perform better in TruthfulQA with fewer parameters pruned before tuning. The accuracy reaches 48.6 and 47.4 when not pruning before tuning, compared to 46.6 and 44.7 when directly pruning to the target sparsity for both 7B and 13B models. Training the LM densely harms the model performance while costing extra memory for all other tasks. These results demonstrate that pruning during training hurts large LM performance under distillation-free settings, and we hypothesize this is due to the training instability issue when parameters are set to zeros during fine-tuning.
