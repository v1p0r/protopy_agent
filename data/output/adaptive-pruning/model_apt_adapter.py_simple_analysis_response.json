It must support runtime modification of both its structural dimensions (via binary masks) and parameter count (via rank adjustment), while maintaining compatibility with frozen pretrained weights.\n\n#### 1. Core Components & Initialization\n- **Base Parameters**: Inherits from LoRA structure:\n  - `W`: Frozen pretrained weight matrix (not updated).\n  - `Wa` \u2208 \u211d^(r\u00d7d_in): Low-rank decomposition matrix, initialized as Gaussian N(0, \u03c3\u00b2). The paper does not specify \u03c3; we use `init_std=0.02` from config.yaml.\n  - `Wb` \u2208 \u211d^(d_out\u00d7r): Low-rank decomposition matrix, initialized as zeros.\n  - `scaling`: Scalar multiplier (default 2.0 per config) applied to low-rank update.\n- **Pruning Masks**:\n  - `mask_in` \u2208 {0,1}^d_in: Binary mask for input dimension. When element j is 0, input feature j is pruned.\n  - `mask_out` \u2208 {0,1}^d_out: Binary mask for output dimension. When element i is 0, output neuron i is pruned.\n  - Masks are learned via salience scoring in `AdaptivePruner`, not trained directly.\n- **Dynamic Rank Support**:\n  - `rank`: Current rank r_apt, initially set to `initial_rank=8` (config).\n  - Must allow safe expansion during training without disrupting optimization.\n\n#### 2. Forward Pass Implementation\nThe forward computation follows Equation (2) in the paper:\n```python\noutput = mask_out * (W + scaling * Wb @ Wa) @ (input * mask_in)\n```\nKey considerations:\n- **Hadamard Product**: Element-wise masking ensures pruned dimensions contribute zero.\n- **Gradient Flow**: Gradients only flow through unpruned parameters due to mask multiplication.\n- **Efficiency**: Since `W` is frozen, only `Wa` and `Wb` are involved in gradient computation.\n- **Integration**: This adapter is injected into specific layers (MHA q/v_proj, FFN dense layers) of base models.\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Rank Adjustment (`increase_rank`)\nThis method enables adaptive tuning by expanding the adapter's capacity:\n- **New Rank Calculation**: \n  ```python\n  new_rank = floor(current_rank * (\u0394_target / \u0394_current))\n  ```\n  where \u0394 denotes total tuning parameters. Called by `AdaptiveTuner.adjust_ranks()`.\n- **Parameter Initialization**:\n  - Expand `Wa` from (r, d_in) \u2192 (r', d_in): Append new rows sampled from N(0, 0.02\u00b2).\n  - Expand `Wb` from (d_out, r) \u2192 (d_out, r'): Append new columns filled with zeros.\n- **Output Preservation**: Zero initialization of new `Wb` columns ensures no change in output pre/post-expansion.\n- **Optimizer Handling**: After rank increase, the trainer resets the optimizer state to avoid instability from sudden shape changes.\n\n#### 4. Weight Merging (`merge_weights`)\nFor inference efficiency, merged weights eliminate adapter overhead:\n```python\nmerged_weight = W + scaling * Wb @ Wa\n```\nPost-merging:\n- The adapter can be removed.\n- Only the merged linear layer remains, reducing FLOPs and memory.\n- Pruning masks remain effective\u2014pruned dimensions stay inactive.\n\n#### 5. Integration with Other Modules\n- **With `AdaptivePruner`**: Receives updated `mask_in` and `mask_out` tensors. Applies gradual updates (\u03b1=0.01) rather than abrupt changes.\n- **With `AdaptiveTuner`**: Exposes current rank and allows rank expansion. Provides access to `Wb` gradients for salience scoring.\n- **With `SelfDistiller`**: Shares `W`, `Wa`, `Wb` between teacher and student when applicable.\n- **With Base Model**: Replaces or wraps original linear layers in transformer architecture.\n\n#### 6. Design Constraints from Paper & Config\n- **Sparsity Control**: Mask shapes determine model size at any step t, guided by `SparsityScheduler` using cubic schedule.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Only small `Wa`/`Wb` matrices are tuned; full `W` remains frozen.\n- **Stability Mechanisms**:\n  - Gradual mask decay (not instant zeroing).\n  - Output-preserving rank expansion.\n  - Optimizer reset on shape change.\n\n#### 7. Unclear Aspects to Address\n- **Initialization Variance**: Use `init_std=0.02` from config unless contradicted later.\n- **Mask Gradient Blocking**: Ensure masks are detached from graph during backward pass.\n- **Layer-Specific Behavior**: Whether all MHA layers apply adapters uniformly depends on global configuration.\n\nThis module serves as the central interface between static pretrained models and dynamic adaptation logic, enabling both structured pruning and efficient fine-tuning within a unified framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1764810937, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1078, "prompt_tokens": 38960, "total_tokens": 40038, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}]
