This component plays a critical role in generating the results that directly compare APT against baselines as presented in Tables 2, 3, and other evaluation tables in the paper.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n### 1. Task Performance Evaluation\nThe evaluator must compute appropriate metrics based on the task type, consistent with the paper's experimental setup:\n\n- **Classification tasks** (SST-2, MNLI, etc.): Accuracy\n- **Question Answering** (SQuAD v2.0): F1 score  \n- **Summarization** (CNN/DM): ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L scores\n- **Large Model Evaluation** (LLaMA on Alpaca): Average of four Open LLM Leaderboard tasks:\n  - 25-shot ARC\n  - 10-shot HellaSwag  \n  - 5-shot MMLU\n  - Zero-shot TruthfulQA\n\nThese metrics must be computed using the same methodology as described in Section 5.1 and evaluated through the lm-eval-harness package mentioned in the paper.\n\n### 2. Efficiency Metrics Measurement\nThe evaluator must measure both training and inference efficiency metrics as defined in Section 5.3:\n\n#### Training Efficiency Metrics:\n- **Relative training peak memory**: Compare to full fine-tuning baseline\n- **Time to Accuracy (TTA)**: For small models, time to reach 97% of final accuracy\n- **Training time per step**: For large models like LLaMA\n\n#### Inference Efficiency Metrics:\n- **Inference peak memory**: Measured via `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`\n- **Inference speedup**: Based on throughput (data processed per second)\n- **Inference time**: Reported in milliseconds\n\nAll efficiency metrics should be normalized relative to baselines (FT and LoRA) as shown in Tables 2-3, with \"\u2193\" indicating smaller is better.\n\n## Implementation Details from config.yaml\n\nThe configuration file provides specific parameters that must be respected:\n\n```yaml\nevaluation:\n  inference_batch_size:\n    small_model: 128\n    llama_7b: 32\n    llama_13b: 4\n  metrics:\n    classification: accuracy\n    qa: f1\n    summarization: rouge\n    instruction_following: lm_eval_harness\n  eval_tasks:\n    open_llm_leaderboard:\n      - arc: 25-shot\n      - hellaswag: 10-shot\n      - mmlu: 5-shot\n      - truthfulqa: 0-shot\n  normalize_metrics: true\n  baseline_ft: true\n  baseline_lora: true\n```\n\nThis indicates:\n- Different batch sizes for different model sizes during inference testing\n- Specific metric types mapped to task categories\n- Use of lm-eval-harness for instruction-following evaluation\n- Normalization of metrics to baselines (FT and LoRA)\n\n## Method Breakdown\n\n### evaluate()\nThis method will:\n1. Iterate through the test dataset using the configured batch size\n2. Perform forward passes to generate predictions\n3. Compute task-specific metrics based on the task type\n4. Return a dictionary containing all relevant performance metrics\n5. For instruction-following tasks, interface with lm-eval-harness as specified\n\n### measure_efficiency()\nThis method will:\n1. Record GPU memory usage before and after inference using PyTorch's memory tracking\n2. Measure inference time by timing multiple forward passes and calculating average\n3. Calculate throughput (samples processed per second)\n4. Normalize all efficiency metrics according to the specified baselines\n5. Return efficiency metrics in the format required for comparison tables\n\n## Integration Requirements\n\nThe Evaluator must work seamlessly with:\n- The trained model containing APT adapters\n- The APTAdapter's merge_weights() functionality for inference optimization\n- DatasetLoader for proper data formatting\n- Configuration settings from config.yaml regarding batch sizes and evaluation parameters\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe output must match the structure of the paper's evaluation tables:\n- Performance metrics at the precision reported (e.g., 86.4 for MNLI)\n- Efficiency metrics normalized to baselines with appropriate directional indicators\n- Raw values available for reproduction (as referenced in Appendix I)\n\nThis evaluator will be crucial for demonstrating APT's claimed advantages: maintaining up to 98% task performance when pruning 60% of RoBERTa/T5 parameters while reducing training memory by up to 70% and speeding up fine-tuning by up to 8\u00d7.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1764811331, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 974, "prompt_tokens": 38961, "total_tokens": 39935, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 38784}}}]
