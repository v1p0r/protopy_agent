\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper introduces APT, a paradigm for improving the efficiency of training and inference in pre-trained LMs. While our primary goal is to advance machine learning, particularly in the efficiency of LMs and their applications, we recognize potential broader societal impacts. APT significantly reduces training and inference costs and contributes to lower resource consumption for a wide range of applications. This could have a positive environmental impact but might lead to potential model misuse due to lower resource requirements. Additionally, while APT does not introduce new ethical concerns, it might inherit existing issues in language models, for example, biases in training data. We explicitly ask users of APT to be aware of these risks and follow best practices in data selection and model monitoring to mitigate potential harms.
