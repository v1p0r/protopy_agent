{"abstract": "\nAgentic Design of Compositional Machines\n", "Introduction": "The history of human progress is, at its core, the history of machines, just as the ancient Greeks built the Antikythera mechanism to predict eclipses and Leonardo da Vinci envisioned machines to fly. Today, as large language models (LLMs) begin to approximate—and in some domains, surpass—human cognitive abilities, a natural question arises:  [leftmargin=1em, rightmargin=1em] Can computational models, like humans, conceive and create complex machines to achieve purposeful goals?    At the heart of this question lie two tightly coupled concepts: compositionality , how parts are put together into assemblies, and functionality , the tasks these assemblies perform as they interact with external forces or inputs. While foundation models are already capable of synthesizing 3D shapes and building mechanical parts with computer-aided design (CAD) models, it is the complex compositional structures, in which very different parts and components are orchestrated to smoothly move together, that realize a vast array of demands. Just as a clock emerges from the composition of simple and standardized mechanical elements such as gears and flywheels, these same elements, when combined differently, can give rise to entirely different machines, such as a sewing machine. On the other hand, the same functionality may be realized by different part compositions, just as both cars and bicycles can transport a person from place to place. Put it concisely: composition is shaped by functionality, and functionality is realized through composition . Since such compositional machines can be expressed programmatically, with types, placements and articulations of parts represented in structured code that LLMs can generate and manipulate, we formalize the above question as:  [leftmargin=1em, rightmargin=1em] Can LLMs, given standardized mechanical parts and a reward function for the desired functionality, discover diverse spatial part compositions that maximize the reward and complete the task?    The question is not only about the pursuit of intelligence but also about the practice of engineering. Modern design pipelines are often long and costly, especially in large-scale projects where each iteration demands substantial resources. These projects accumulate vast collections of documents and blueprints, making it difficult to trace, retrieve, or reuse past design efforts. Much essential know-how is passed informally across teams and generations, and in many cases, never fully recorded and since forgotten. An automated machine design system could directly address these challenges. Rather than merely mimicking patterns from historical designs, such a system should be agentic: capable of exploring the exponentially large design space, leveraging prior knowledge to create novel designs for new demands and constraints, and improving them through feedback. To investigate this concretely, we introduce BesiegeField , an interactive environment built on the machine-design game of Besiege FOOTREF2 . The environment allows for construction of simple mechanical machines with standardized and semantic parts such as gears and wheels, and supports customized physical scenarios in which LLM agents can test constructed machines and evaluate their dynamics and interactions. Building on BesiegeField , we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with different agent designs and strategies for selecting and placing basic mechanical elements to build machines for representative functional demands, a task we term compositional machine design . Through these experiments, we empirically identify key capabilities required for this task: accurate spatial reasoning, high-level knowledge of design strategies, and instruction-following in spatial domains. Since only a few proprietary LLMs achieve satisfactory results, we further investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the performance of open-source LLMs. To this end, we curate a small machine design dataset to cold-start RL finetuning, perform exploratory RL experiments, and highlight key challenges that chart directions for future research. In summary, our contributions are listed below: 1. We introduce and formalize the task of compositional machine design , where machines are assembled from standardized parts to achieve functional goals.  2. We present BesiegeField , an interactive environment that enables LLM agents to construct, simulate, and evaluate compositional machines in customized physical scenarios.  3. We systematically benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and different agentic workflow designs on representative machine-design tasks.  4. We explore RL finetuning of LLMs on this task, for which we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct experiments, and highlight the key challenges. ", "Compositional Machine Design": "Full machine design involves many coupled elements: geometry, statics and dynamics, demand analysis, failure modes, safety, and even legal constraints BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . To isolate a tractable subproblem, we focus on the structural composition of machines: how standardized parts are spatially arranged and mechanically linked to produce functional behavior. We refer to this task, introduced in the previous section, as compositional machine design . It captures two essential components: (i) the static geometry of a machine as a part-based assembly, and (ii) its compatibility with functional demands, typically assessed through physical simulation. This abstraction omits considerations such as manufacturing constraints, material properties, or domain-specific regulations, but retains the core spatial and behavioral reasoning challenges relevant to design. This special task of compositional machine design mirrors challenges found in other exploration domains. For example, automatic theorem proving involves a compositional and exponentially large action space, while electronic design automation (EDA) for chip layouts requires spatial reasoning to place components of varying shapes under spatial constraints (albeit in a more regular and grid-constrained fashion than mechanical parts in machines). A unique challenge in machine design, however, is its dependence on diverse long-horizon behaviors, both autonomous and non-autonomous, within an environment. Specifically, a machine may behave differently when operated in different ways ( e.g. , a bicycle when pedaled versus when braking) or under different external conditions ( e.g. , driving a car in sunny versus rainy weather). Similarly, many sophisticated machines cannot function without appropriate control policies, as exemplified by aircraft that rely on fly-by-wire systems to stabilize their inherently unstable aerodynamic configurations (which would otherwise be unflyable by a human pilot alone). A key open problem is therefore how to account for the interplay among physics, control policy, and compositional structure in machine design. It is worth noting that, unlike in math theorem proving where one valid proof often suffices (even though multiple proofs may still be valued), design domains typically require generating a diverse set of candidate solutions. This diversity is essential to (i) differentiate products, (ii) adapt to unpredictable market demands, and (iii) account for uncertainty in real-world testing and deployment. Consequently, the task places greater emphasis on diversity, and a model for compositional machine design should function more like a generative model than a simple reward maximizer.", "BesiegeField : Playground for Compositional Machine Design": "Studying the full problem of compositional machine design is challenging, as it involves the coupling of many interacting factors. We therefore focus on a minimalist, component-level setting in which machines are constructed primarily from cuboid primitives with clear functional semantics, together with a small set of specialized exceptions, and operate under a shared control policy in an environment governed by rigid-body and elastic mechanics. This abstraction allows us to properly benchmark the capabilities of existing LLMs and to assess the upper bounds, potential, and challenges of agentic systems and RL algorithms. To this end, we create BesiegeField , an interactive environment adapted from the machine-building game Besiege, in which players design medieval machines to complete tasks such as destroying castles. Powered by the built-in physics engine, BesiegeField supports physical simulation of mechanical systems such as vehicles and catapults in user-customized environments with terrains, obstacles, external forces ( e.g. , wind and gravity), and co-existing agents. The environment provides nearly 80 types of building blocks (examples illustrated in Fig. FIGREF29 ), including passive ones like drills and logs, and powered ones like powered cogs and wheels. Machines are constructed by sequentially attaching new parts to vacant and attachable faces of existing blocks, starting from a root block and thus forming a “construction tree” (indeed a directly acyclic graph (DAG), in the sense of operation orders; one block can has two parents in the DAG; the actual structures may contain loops). Powered blocks can receive control commands, allowing machines to be operated precisely. During simulation, complete state information (e.g., the position and velocity of each block in the constructed machine) can be recorded for model feedback. Finally, the environment supports custom modifications and can be extended with additional block types and richer physics ( e.g. , simple fluid simulation). Further details are explained in Appendix SECREF10 .  BesiegeField is unique in balancing real-world geometry and physics, part-level semantics, and simple compositional rules. Block-stacking environments like LEGO BIBREF2 and Minecraft BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 allow intuitive combinatorial assembly but do not natively provide realistic physical simulation and rely on generic blocks with limited semantic meaning. CAD modeling BIBREF4 captures fine-grained geometry and interactions, but its complexity makes rules cumbersome and sequences prohibitively long. By contrast, BesiegeField uses semantically meaningful parts with cuboid-like construction rules—supporting realistic physics while remaining abstract enough for tractable composition. This calibrated balance enables the study of compositional creativity and geometric reasoning at a level of difficulty that both differentiates algorithms and permits rapid experimentation. Moreover, unlike prior environments, BesiegeField supports machine destruction, adding durability and failure analysis to the design space.", "::Benchmark Settings": " Representative target machines and tasks. To benchmark and characterize the performance of different LLMs for agentic compositional machine design, we consider two conceptually simple yet representative target machines to build: car and catapult as shown in Fig. FIGREF8 . While success in both requires understanding part semantics and structural syntax, car building primarily tests static relational reasoning, such as enforcing correct part orientations, symmetry, and stability; in contrast, catapult building challenges models with dynamic relational reasoning, where parts must coordinate over time to produce causal mechanical effects. Moreover, the two tasks are simple enough to be constructed with only a few blocks so that they fit within the LLM’s context window, yet complex enough to require explicit reasoning about construction strategies and causal dependencies. We evaluate the performance of cars and catapults by their moving distance and their throwing distance ( i.e. , the moving distance of the stone), respectively, towards a fixed and given direction. During each simulation, the generated machine will be placed at a designated position, and the active parts will be powered after a few seconds. As there can be reward hacking issues, for catapults experiments we surround the designated machine placement position with moderate-height walls. More details about the target machines, rewards, and environments can be found in Appendix SECREF10 .  Machine representations. In BesiegeField , the default XML representation records all blocks with global 3D positions and uses a built-in algorithm to recover connections. Such a representation, however, does not well encode machine structures. Instead, we propose a parsimonious representation aligned with the game’s building logic, based on pairwise relative attachment relationships (i.e., how one part is rotated and attached to another). Details are explained in Appendix SECREFU78 .  Performance metrics. We evaluate our agentic systems using the following quantitative metrics: 1) file validity rate , the proportion of generated JSON files that can be successfully parsed into machine construction trees; 2) spatial validity rate , the proportion of generated machines that are free from self-collisions; 3) machine validity rate , the proportion of machines that satisfy both file and spatial validity; 4) mean and maximum simulation scores , the average and highest rewards achieved by generated machines in the environment.  Environment feedback. For the simple target machines car and catapult , we consider environment feedback within a time window of 5 seconds that is long enough to characterize their designated functionalities. Specifically, for car we consider maximum speed and driving distance; for catapult , we consider boulder throwing distance and maximum height. We also record the machines' global orientation and broken parts information (if any). Details are elaborated in Appendix SECREFU80 .", "::Agentic Workflow Design": " Single-agent setting. We first benchmark if a single LLM agent alone is capable of completing the task. Specifically, one LLM agent is provided with the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements ( e.g. , moving an object forward). The agent generates a chain-of-thought (CoT; BIBREF5 ) to reason about what is needed and why, and then derives an abstract plan (e.g., connecting a lever to a container with a boulder). This plan is later translated into the construction tree representation.  Iterative editing. Because compositional machine design requires both low-level spatial reasoning and high-level ideation, a single agent rarely produces satisfactory machines. We therefore also design an iterative editing workflow that involves three major agents: 1) designer , which produces an initial plan from the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements; 2) refiner , a self-critic agent that which evaluates a draft against requirements and constraints and proposes multiple candidate revisions at each step; 3) environment querier , an agent that runs machine simulation and summarizes the environment feedback, in the way that it always provides global information such as machine orientation throughout the trajectory but selectively reports the feedback on specific blocks ( e.g. , position and speed) for further machine refinement. The workflow begins with a draft from the designer that is later critiqued by an inspector , which assess the designed machine in an abstract fashion, then polished once by a refiner. The design then undergoes a fixed number of iterations, each consisting of one querier and one refiner step. At refiner stages, multiple candidates are generated for running Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS; BIBREF6 ). The best design found in this search process is selected as output.  Hierarchical construction. Inspired by typical human design processes as well as recent designs of agentic systems BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , we introduce a meta-designer agent that first analyzes the requirements and constraints, and then constructs a high-level blueprint of the major functional blocks ( e.g. , the suspension system) and their interconnections. With this blueprint in place, we adopt an autoregressive strategy to build the machine block by block: 1) we begin with the first functional block and dispatch the job to eight parallel builder agents; 2) the valid designs from this stage are evenly distributed to another eight builder agents to construct the second block; and 3) the process iterates in this manner until the entire machine is assembled. Empirically, we find that the meta-designer typically decomposes a machine into three to four functional blocks.", "::Key Empirical Observations": " General observations. We find compositional machine design to be a challenging task for LLMs (Fig. FIGREF14 and Table TABREF15 ), though not intractable: Gemini 2.5 Pro can consistently construct visually sensible machines with non-trivial performance. We find no evidence that reasoning models outperform non-reasoning ones, suggesting the main bottleneck lies in LLMs’ limited 3D understanding and/or in-context learning. We also find that LLMs, especially reasoning models, still exhibit some spatial and physical reasoning as exemplified by the CoT from Gemini Pro 2.5 (Fig. FIGREF10 ), much like a world model in text space.  Failure patterns. We identified common failure patterns in LLM-generated machines (Fig. FIGREF89 ): 1) incorrect part orientations ; 2) incorrect part placements , where parts attach to wrong parents; 3) instruction-following failures , where elements of the high-level blueprint are not strictly observed; 4) flawed high-level reasoning , where LLMs fail to recognize correct physics or essential components.  Effect of environment feedback. It is unsurprising that with the more environment feedback the agents receive, the better performance of generated machines improve in general (Table TABREF101 ).  Effect of edit history. We find that edit histories are generally helpful in decreasing the number of failure attempts in creating valid machines (Table TABREF24 ), which underscores the importance of longer context window of base models for efficient exploration.  Hierarchical design. We observe the mean performance improves with hierarchical design only when the abstract-level reasoning on blueprints is reliable, as shown by the performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro. In the meantime, consistent with the intuition that hierarchical design is more structured and principled, it generally yields lower variance in obtained scores.  Effect of CoT reasoning. As shown in Fig. FIGREF89 , LLMs often fail to faithfully translate high-level machine design plans in their CoT into semantically and geometrically consistent machine construction trees. To better assess the impact of CoT reasoning on high-level design, we feed the CoT generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro (the best-performing model) to other LLMs, prompting them to directly output construction trees. The resulting machines generally show improved performance (Fig. FIGREF112 ) and highlight the critical role of high-level semantic reasoning in machine design.  CoT-machine correspondence. Though the CoT often provides a reasonably high-level blueprint, agents may still generate machines that deviate from the intended structure (Fig. FIGREF89 ). We hypothesize that this misalignment is a key reason many LLMs struggle to build better machines.  Machine representation. We experiment with a coordinate-only representation derived from the default XML (Appendix SECREFU76 ) and our construction tree representation. Results show that the coordinate-only representation performs significantly worse (Table TABREF25 ), implying that explicit structural information is necessary for LLM understanding.  3D information. We observe that (Table TABREF23 ) the performance generally improves when we also feed parsed 3D information into the context of LLMs, which implies that LLMs are less capable of understanding relative spatial relationship ( e.g. , construction trees).", "": "Although agentic systems show promise in compositional machine design, simply scaling system size is unlikely to be economical, as errors compound rapidly. Like humans who internalize experience, LLM agents should consolidate new knowledge into weights. We thus explore reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in BesiegeField to develop machine-design capabilities.", "::Experimental Settings": " Cold-start finetuning and dataset curation. Following recent RLVR practices BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , we curated a small dataset to cold-start LLMs by aligning their reasoning process with expert CoT. Specifically, we collected textual descriptions of machine functionalities from Besiege player communities and prompted Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate corresponding machines. After filtering out invalid generations, we obtained 9,984 valid machine–CoT pairs. We then used this dataset to perform supervised finetuning on Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct for 12 epochs. Additional training details are provided in Appendix SECREFU96 .  Reward design. We use the reward INLINEFORM0 where INLINEFORM1 indicates whether constraints are satisfied (Appendix SECREFU79 ). For car , INLINEFORM2 is the maximum travel distance; for catapult , it is the product of the boulder’s maximum height and distance, penalizing solutions that are extreme in only one dimension.  RL finetuning settings. We finetune agents specialized in building a single type of machine (either car or catapult ), making our setup closely aligned with one-shot RLVR BIBREF13 where a single prompt is used throughout the RL process. We adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO; BIBREF14 ) with LoRA parametrization BIBREF15 (rank 64) and mixed-precision training to finetune the cold-started model. We evaluate both the standard GRPO advantage estimator and the pass@k variant BIBREF16 . In the latter case, due to the implementation of the RLVR framework verl BIBREF17 , the number of rollouts is set equal to INLINEFORM0 . Each experiment is run for 400 iterations on 8 A100 GPUs with per-GPU batch size of 1 and gradient accumulation of 8. We apply KL regularization with strength 0.001 to encourage the model to remain close to its initialization.", "::Main Results and Observations": " General results. As shown in Fig. FIGREF104 , RL finetuning can generally improve the mean performance, mostly by increasing the percentage that machines are valid (including file validity, machine validity and satisfaction of minimum performance threshold). In the meantime, we also find that the maximum reward increases in our best setting. Similar to observations in many other RLVR settings, the entropy of the output distribution quickly drops even with regularization.  Pass@k advantage vs. Pass@1 advantage. Since we eventually care about the best performing designs, especially given the low validity rate, our default setting adopts Pass@k advantage estimator. Indeed, Pass@k finetuning is more likely to discovery promising machine designs (Fig. FIGREF102 ).  Evolution of generated machines during finetuning. In Fig. FIGREF20 , we qualitatively examine how models refine their designs over the course of finetuning. We observe that models typically make detail-level adjustments, such as shifting part positions, while keeping the same high-level design strategy rather than exploring alternative strategies. Although these strategies are often reasonable, the models struggle to find precise configurations that enable smooth coordination among parts. This precision is especially critical for sophisticated mechanisms like catapults to function properly.  Cold-start. Not surprisingly, we find that cold-start alone does not enable models to produce satisfactory designs, and that finetuning on the cold-start model is better than on the base model (Table TABREF18 ).", "Discussions and Intriguing Insights": " Capabilities for compositional machine design. Although tasks such as visual understanding and generation also depend on spatial, physical, and semantic reasoning, compositional machine design introduces unique requirements for LLM capabilities. Without precise spatial placement of machine parts, a design may fail to function correctly; a gear train, for example, will not transmit rotation if the gears are misaligned. Since the design process is typically hierarchical, successful LLMs must be able to accurately translate high-level blueprints into detailed geometric designs. In addition, machine design spans both concept-level reasoning and detailed specification. This dual demand often leads to large design documents and calls for a form of “visual reasoning” expressed through text, similar to what has been studied in LLMs applied to scalable vector graphics (SVG) and CAD models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 . Multimodal reasoning is also important because effective machine design typically relies on integrating textual descriptions with visual or schematic representations. In this work, however, we focus only on pure LLM-based reasoning to isolate and analyze its capabilities for compositional machine design.  Challenges in agentic machine design systems. The task of machine design faces similar challenges found in agentic systems in domains such as legal services and other knowledge-intensive fields. A key difficulty is the highly varied requirements and domain knowledge of different customers. To address this, LLMs need to acquire task-specific knowledge through in-context learning or finetuning. In addition, the complexity of design tasks often requires multiple agents to coordinate, and such pipelines can suffer error accumulation when the base LLM lacks sufficient capability.  Exploration in machine design space. Different from tasks such as theorem proving, the goal of compositional machine design is to discover structures that more effectively achieve desired functionalities. Rather than reusing existing solutions, a practical design agent should be able to propose novel strategies, structural layouts, and part specifications as machine complexity increases. Meeting this requirement calls for RL finetuning methods that prevent models from collapsing into a narrow set of strategies and structures, which recent methods aim to alleviate BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 . This demand is closely related to continual RL BIBREF25 , since finetuned LLMs must avoid catastrophic forgetting, maintain its reasoning ability, and consolidate learned strategies, which is particularly important because large-scale machine design datasets are rare and commercially infeasible to collect.", "Related Work and Concluding Remarks": " 3D graphics codes for generative modeling. There is a long history in 3D asset generation and engineering design of representing the construction of a target instance as a program or sequence of operations in a domain-specific language BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 , BIBREF28 , which we refer to here as 3D graphics codes BIBREF18 , BIBREF29 . Unlike geometric representations such as point clouds or meshes, these codes describe objects at a higher semantic level, capturing part composition, design constraints, and user operations in modeling software. Similar to programming languages, 3D graphics codes are inherently discrete and are typically generated with autoregressive models trained from scratch BIBREF30 or with LLMs finetuned on curated datasets BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 . Much of the existing work centers on CAD scripts for individual parts BIBREF33 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF4 or Blender macros for single assets BIBREF34 . Whereas recent studies on LEGO assemblies BIBREF3 , Minecraft structures BIBREF2 , BIBREF35 , and procedural scene generation BIBREF27 , BIBREF29 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF30 introduce richer compositionality, they still fall short of the task of compositional machine design, which requires assemblies that both function under physical laws and exhibit the precise geometry of real objects.  LLM agents. LLM agents are language models organized to operate in iterative loops of perception and action BIBREF37 , BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 . They interact with external tools BIBREF40 , BIBREF41 , BIBREF42 , BIBREF43 , respond to signals from simulated or real environments BIBREF44 , BIBREF45 , incorporate self-reflection to refine their outputs BIBREF46 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF47 , BIBREF48 , and are commonly organized into multi-agent systems that coordinate roles and exchange information BIBREF49 , BIBREF50 , BIBREF9 . These designs move beyond one-shot text generation and establish LLMs as adaptive decision makers capable of long-horizon reasoning. Approaches that introduce search over possible solutions BIBREF51 , BIBREF52 , BIBREF53 or reflection on prior attempts BIBREF54 , BIBREF55 , BIBREF56 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF48 have enabled progress on increasingly complex tasks. LLM agents have already been used in design tasks such as code synthesis BIBREF57 , BIBREF58 , BIBREF59 , CAD design BIBREF19 and game environments BIBREF60 , BIBREF2 . Partially inspired by these developments, BIBREF61 proposed a prototypical agent-based design framework that generates mechanical structures from text prompts. Their system treats structure generation as a one-shot process and delegates the search for optimal geometric and physical parameters to external optimization tools. In contrast, our work with BesiegeField explores how LLM agents can directly and iteratively bridge compositional structures to functional goals, framing design as a process of reasoning and adaptation with both accurate simulation and intuitive physics.  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Recent studies indicate that, by running RL finetuning with verifiable rewards from simulators or verifiers, reasoning abilities emerge BIBREF14 , BIBREF62 , BIBREF63 , even when single prompt is used during finetuning BIBREF13 . Yet, many methods exhibit loss of diversity as output entropy collapses during reinforcement learning and thus do not fully enable LLMs to explore novel solutions. Examples of mitigation methods include explicit entropy or KL regularization BIBREF22 , BIBREF64 , Pass@k training BIBREF16 , BIBREF21 , and distribution-matching objectives like generative flow networks BIBREF20 , BIBREF65 . BesiegeField provides verifiable rewards and thus enables direct application of RLVR to compositional machine design.  Concluding remarks . We introduced compositional machine design , a simplified yet challenging task that reflects core aspects of real-world machine design. To evaluate LLM performance on this task, we developed BesiegeField , an interactive environment based on the game Besiege. Our results with agentic systems and reinforcement learning demonstrate that LLMs hold promise for solving this problem. While we did not exhaustively explore all designs or integrate multi-modal information, our findings underscore the need to advance fundamental LLM algorithms and capabilities, and point toward exciting future directions in machine design.", "Acknowledgment": "We sincerely thank the developers of Besiege for creating the game and fostering an open and vibrant community, without which our exploration of this exciting idea would not have been possible. tocsectionAppendix", "Details on the BesiegeField Environment": "We built BesiegeField by creating plug-in modules for the game Besiege that create interfaces to allow flexible composition of parts (once certain rules are obeyed), control policies on multiple powered parts ( e.g. . powered cogs), recording of state information of any block ( e.g. , position, orientation, part integrity, etc.) and settings of termination conditions ( e.g. , some part passing through a line). BesiegeField supports multi-process launching and thus allows for efficient parallel RL training. As the game natively supports multi-player gameplay, BesiegeField can naturally be applied to multi-agent RL settings. As the game Besiege (shown in Fig. FIGREF28 ) is built with the (mostly) open-sourced Unity3D game engine FOOTREF26 , BesiegeField is highly-customizable: the environment 1) natively supports modification of physical parameters, external forces, terrains and obstacles ( e.g. , stone buildings) and 2) allows for extension patches (known as mods FOOTREF27 ) to introduce other mechanisms, such as new block types, fluid simulation and many other components.", "Details on the BesiegeField Environment::Construction Rule": "Each machine is built by attaching new blocks to the existing structure, starting from a special root block. For convenience, we describe each construction step as an “attacher” block (child) connected to an “attachee” block (parent). As an attacher, each block has exactly one face available for connection; as an attachee, each block has none to several attachable faces. Once a face is used, it is considered occupied and cannot be reused. If, after construction, the free end of a block happens to coincide with an attachable face of an existing block, the two blocks are automatically connected. A few special blocks violate the rule described above, such as spring. These blocks have two ends and thus must have two parent blocks, do not have physical volume can be attached to either vacant or occupied faces of other blocks. Finally, each block can be rescaled and rotated after construction. Since post-construction scaling and rotation introduce unnecessary complexity into our pipeline, we exclude them from our experiments and leave their handling to future work.", "Details on the BesiegeField Environment::Simulation": "Once constructed, the machine will be placed at the designated pose indicated by the position and orientation of the starting block (not necessary near the ground, but there is a maximum height constraint). The machine will be subject to gravity and Newtonian physical laws (rigid and elastic ones) after placement.", "Details on the BesiegeField Environment::Blocks": "Out of the 75 construction blocks provided by Besiege, we filter out a list of 27 blocks (shown in Fig. FIGREF29 ) that are most relevant to build machines with classical mechanical mechanisms such as levers and trusses. 1.  Starting Block : the root of any mechanism; initial orientation is along z+ axis.  2.  Small Wooden Block : a cubic basic construction block.  3.  Wooden Block : shaped like two small wooden blocks attached together.  4.  Wooden Rod : a slender, fragile construction block.  5.  Log : shaped like three small wooden blocks arranged in parallel.  6.  Steering Hinge : powered; controls rotation of sub-blocks, swinging left or right along the axis perpendicular to its placement axis.  7.  Steering Block : powered; rotates blocks along its placement axis.  8.  Powered Wheel : radius 1m; provides ground movement.  9.  Unpowered Wheel : identical to the powered wheel but requires external force to rotate.  10.  Large Powered Wheel : larger version of the powered wheel (radius 3m).  11.  Large Unpowered Wheel : unpowered version of the large powered wheel.  12.  Small Wheel : functions like a caster wheel (e.g., shopping cart), unpowered, 1.2m long.  13.  Roller Wheel : similar to the small wheel, but shorter (0.8m).  14.  Universal Joint : freely rotates around its placement axis, unpowered.  15.  Hinge : swings up and down along the axis perpendicular to its placement axis, unpowered.  16.  Ball Joint : swings freely in all directions, unpowered.  17.  Axle Connector : similar to a ball joint but allows unrestricted INLINEFORM0 rotation.  18.  Suspension : shaped like a wooden block, it can buffer forces from all directions.  19.  Rotating Block : powered; motor-like block that generates torque and rotates about its local y-axis.  20.  Grabber : grabs objects on contact and can release them.  21.  Boulder : a large rock, loosely attached; useful for throwing.  22.  Grip Pad : block with the highest friction.  23.  Elastic Pad : block with the highest elasticity.  24.  Container : typically used to hold a boulder.  25.  Spring : can contract; one of the special blocks that can have two parent attachments (without occupying attachable faces).  26.  Brace : reinforces structural strength.  27.  Ballast : a heavy cubic block used as a counterweight. ", "Details on the BesiegeField Environment::Tasks": "We define a set of tasks in which the goal is to construct machines within a designated building area to accomplish specific objectives. 1.  Movement. Referred to as the car task in the main text, the objective is to build a machine capable of driving along tracks and traversing various terrains.  2.  Throw. Referred to as the catapult task in the main text, the goal is to construct a machine that can launch boulders over long distances. To prevent unintended strategies (e.g., carrying the boulder instead of throwing it, or letting it roll along the ground), the building area is enclosed by a medium-height wall.  3.  Delivery. This task requires building a machine that can transport a large stone forward across different terrains (Fig. FIGREF70 ).  4.  Pick. The objective here is to design a machine that can retrieve a stone located at the bottom of a deep well (Fig. FIGREF69 ).  For many of these tasks, we introduce multiple difficulty levels (not used in the experiments reported in this paper) to encourage progressively more sophisticated designs: 1.  Movement and Delivery. We consider: (1) randomized terrains with stones and wooden rods ( e.g. , Fig. FIGREF67 ), (2) curved tracks (Fig. FIGREF72 ), and (3) obstacles such as height-limiting bars.  2.  Throw. We design: (1) varied objectives, such as requiring the boulder to pass through an aerial ring (Fig. FIGREF71 ) or land precisely within a small target zone, (2) environmental factors such as wind, and (3) obstacles, including height restrictions either within the building area or along the boulder’s trajectory. ", "Search Strategies in Machine Modification Loops": "Apart from the MCTS strategy used in the main experiments, we also evaluate two alternatives: (i) best-of-N, where we select the best-performing machine out of N candidates, and (ii) random search, which mimics best-of-N but instead selects a random candidate. For clarity, we refer to one consecutive “querier–refiner” call as a search node (consistent with our MCTS setup). Unlike classical MCTS or best-of-N, here each search node is allowed up to five retries to prevent child statistics from being too sparse. We perform INLINEFORM0 search rounds, each aiming to obtain 5 valid candidate machines (though this may fail; if fewer than 5 are found, the parent node’s machine is used as a candidate).

In Fig. TABREF74 we show the improvement of machine performance with respect to the number of search rounds used. In Fig. FIGREF75 we compare the efficiency of different search methods in our agentic compositional machine design setting.

Below is a concrete example: Basically, each block in the machine is independently recorded without mentioning its adjacent blocks. For most of the block types, only the block type and its pose (position + orientation) are recorded. For special blocks that have two parents, the other end has to be specified, for which the corresponding dictionary has an additional entry of “end-position”.", "::Construction Tree Representation": "With our parsimonious construction tree representation, the example machine above is represented by the following the following JSON list: Specifically, the ordered list of dictionaries of the machine construction JSON file represents the construction order of blocks. Each dictionary contains the following information of corresponding block: 1) “type”: block type; 2) “id”: the order ID of this block (the same as the order in the list), included so that LLMs do not have to parse it by itself; 3) “parent”, the ID of its parent block; 4) “face_id”, the face of the block's parent to which the block is attached. In cases that the block has two parents ( e.g. , a string that connects both parts), we use “parent_a” and “parent_b” to record both parents; similar for “face_id”. Note: the first block with “id” 0 is always the unique starting block, of which the local position and rotation are always zero.", "::Reward Setting": "Here we elaborate on the reward design for RL experiments in Sec. SECREFU17 . Our reward is in the form of INLINEFORM0 where INLINEFORM1 is the boolean representing machine validity and INLINEFORM2 is the task-specific performance metric.  Car . We set INLINEFORM0 to 1 as long as the policy produces a machine that can be parsed from the generated construction tree and can be successfully placed into the environment without any self-collision; otherwise it is set to 0. INLINEFORM1 is set to the distance between the starting position and the end position of the root block.  Catapult . For INLINEFORM0 to be 1 in this task, the machine has to satisfy an additional constraint compared to the car task: the maximum height of the boulder position during simulation must be greater than a threshold of 3m. As explained in the main text, INLINEFORM1 for INLINEFORM2 is the product of the maximum height and maximum distance (towards some pre-defined direction) during simulation.", "::Environment Feedback": "In principle, we are able to obtain all state variables of each single part of a simulated machine. Due to the space complexity of the simulation results, not all information can be fed to LLM agents. Here we consider a minimal set of environment feedback information that the environment querier always gathers and returns to the refiner. Below are the minimal set of feedback information for each task:  Car. 1) machine orientation; 2) machine maximum moving distance (towards a designated direction); 3) machine max speed; 4) machine average speed per second; 5) machine position per 0.2 second (atomic time).  Catapult. 1) boulder maximum distance (horizontal, towards a designated distance); 2) boulder maximum height; 3) boulder position per 0.2 second (atomic time). Beyond these basic pieces of feedback, the querier, after seeing the candidate machine and its simulation results, in our default setting selectively extract a subset of environment feedback given its speculation on the issues of the simulated machine. For instance, parts during simulation may collide with each other and break. Such behavior carries important hints on why machines fail, and an LLM agent with sufficient capability in spatial and physics understanding can possibly identify the vulnerable blocks in the design. Below we elaborate on the additional information that the querier may gather: 1. Block index to query;  2. Time interval of interest (states outside this interval will not be considered);  3. Feedback type of interest (one or more from the list) Position; Orientation; Velocity; Length (for spring only)  3.1. Position;  3.2. Orientation;  3.3. Velocity;  3.4. Length (for spring only) ", "Challenges in Compositional Machine Design::Failure Patterns": "Generated machines often fail in systematic ways. As shown in Fig. FIGREF89 , we observe several recurring categories of errors, including flawed reasoning, structural attachment errors, incorrect part orientations and failures in instruction following. These diverse failure types highlight both the reasoning and execution challenges inherent in compositional machine design.", "Challenges in Compositional Machine Design::Need for Precision": "In Fig. FIGREF91 we present a simple example to illustrate how the task of compositional machine design requires high precision in the spatial design of configurations of different parts. Even though the high-level design is feasible, the machine in the top row fails to throw the boulder out due to the incorrect position of the container.", "Challenges in Compositional Machine Design::Appearance vs. Performance": "As illustrated in Fig. FIGREF93 , a machine's appearance does not necessarily reflect its actual performance. A design that seems well-aligned with human intuition can fail dramatically, while one that looks awkward or unintuitive may achieve superior results. For LLMs to design machines that are both effective and visually intuitive to humans, reward functions must account not only for task performance but also for stability and other factors that shape human perception of functionality.", "Settings for RL Finetuning::Cold-Start Dataset Curation": "Noticing that Gemini 2.5 Pro produces the most satisfactory machines with reasonable CoT, we adopt the single-agent generation setting and collect Gemini-generated machines along with their CoT. We curated 100 design objectives: 75 captions of machines created by Besiege players from the Internet and 25 authored by us. These 25 prompts are constructed by 1) first writing down simple design objectives that are realizable by BesiegeField and can emerge from some simple rewards, and 2) then introducing environment constraints and machine-specific requirements. Using this prompt dataset, we generate 250 machines per prompt, and after filtering out inappropriate ones (those that fail to parse, cannot be built in the environment, or do not have a specific physics-driven functionality, e.g. , a statue), we obtain 9,984 machines with their corresponding CoT. A sample gallery is shown in Fig. FIGREF95 . We present examples in the curated prompt set: Below we present the text prompts with our simple authoring strategy, which can possibly be scaled with LLMs:", "Settings for RL Finetuning::Cold-Start Details": "In our experiment, we use Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as the base model and train it on the Gemini synthesized dataset. To save GPU memory, we employ the parameter-efficient quantized OFT (QOFT) technique BIBREF70 , BIBREF68 , BIBREF67 , BIBREF69 for updating the model parameters, with OFT block size 64. We use 8-bit training with the 8-bit AdamW optimizer implmented with bitsandbytes BIBREF66 , a learning rate of 1e-6 and a linear warmup schedule (3% of the total training steps).", "Settings for RL Finetuning::RL Experiment Details": "We use verl framework to implement our RL experiments. The LLM is finetuned from Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (with LoRA of rank 64 on all linear layers) using the Gemini-synthesized dataset described above. We set learning rate to 5e-6 with gradient clipping threshold set to 0.5. The GRPO advantage estimator uses an advantage clipping ratio of 0.2. We add a KL penalty (weight 0.001) with respect to the pretrained LLM and do not introduce any entropy regularization. For rollouts, we use a temperature of INLINEFORM0 and top- INLINEFORM1 value of 0.95. Maximum input and output lengths are 3440 and 1168 tokens, respectively. We train each model for 400 update steps which take approximately 48 hours.", "Additional Ablation Studies": " Meta-Designer in hierarchical design. In Table TABREF98 , we show that how a meta-designer for hierarchical design may benefit compositional machine design. Leveraging the knowledge on existing machines, meta-designers can identify the key macro-level mechanical components that are easier to design compared to the whole task, as shown in the results for Gemini 2.5 Pro, Kimi K2 and Llama 4 Scout. However, introducing an additional stage can introduce compounding error and, if the LLM agent is not capable of integrating different macro-level mechanical components, they may lead to lower scores, which we hypothesize is the reason for the failure of hierarchical design in models like Qwen3. Moreover, we examine if the meta-designer should provide step-by-step building instruction for the designer (Fig. FIGREF99 ), or simply provide high-level mechanical component descriptions. We find that a meta-designer that provides more detailed information is beneficial mostly when the base model is powerful enough ( e.g. , Gemini 2.5 Pro).  Effect of feedback-free self-critic. In Table TABREF100 , we show that the inspector agent which does self-critic before running any environment simulation tend to improve performance for models like Gemini 2.5 Pro (the most powerful model for the task of compositional machine design in BesiegeField ) but can fail drastically for models like o3.  Effect of active feedback queries. In Table TABREF101 , we show that the active queries on the environment feedbacks help most of the models achieve better performance, compared to the setting with no environment feedback and that with only environment simulation final scores.  Additional RL results. In Fig. FIGREF102 and FIGREF104 and , we show the maximum scores achieved in the environments with different RL methods plus the validity rate of machines. We visualize the maximum score since, in the case when one is allowed to use inference-time scaling techniques, the best performing machines are the ones people care most about. We show that our settings with Pass@64 training achieves the best maximum score with two different random seeds. In additiona, in Fig. FIGREF106 , we visualize the corresponding Best@N metrics. For completeness, we also visualize the results with our default setting on the task car in Fig. FIGREF103 , FIGREF105 and FIGREF107 .", "Generated Samples::From RL-finetuned Models": "Here, we present some of the best RL samples from rollouts, as well as examples from the agentic workflow. Fig. FIGREF109 displays the RL rollout samples, while Fig. FIGREF111 illustrates the agentic workflow samples.", "Relations between CoT and Machines": "To further investigate if high-level machine blueprint or low-level part placement is more important, we experiment with machine generation of LLMs by generating machine details conditioned on Gemini-generated CoT (instead of on CoT produced by themselves). We find that with Gemini CoT, almost all LLMs design machines that are more visually similar to \"catapults\", as shown in Fig. FIGREF112 . We therefore hypothesize that the major gap between other LLMs, especially open-source ones, and Gemini 2.5 Pro is the abstract-level spatial and physics reasoning on machine designs."}
