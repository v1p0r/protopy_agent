Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of fine-tuning, dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that maintains up to 98% task performance when pruning 60% of the parameters in RoBERTa and T5 models. APT also preserves 86.4% of LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters remaining. Furthermore, speeds up LMs' fine-tuning by up to 8 INLINEFORM0 and reduces large LMs' memory training footprint by up to 70%.

Our intuition is that pre-trained LM parameters contain general knowledge, but their importance to downstream tasks varies. Therefore, we can remove the parameters irrelevant to the fine-tuning task in the early training stage. Early-removing these parameters improves training and inference efficiency while not substantially hurting model accuracy BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 . Meanwhile, continuously adding more parameters for fine-tuning can improve LM performance because task-specific skills live in a subset of LM parameters BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 .",

Our intuition is that pruning LMs during early fine-tuning will not hurt their task performance while reducing training and inference costs. Meanwhile, unlike existing adapters like LoRA BIBREF8 that use fixed tuning parameters, APT adapters dynamically add tuning parameters to accelerate LM convergence with superior task performance. We first introduce the architecture of APT adapters in sec:apt. We then describe how we prune LM parameters at early fine-tuning with low cost in sec:apt-prune and adaptively tune LMs to recover task performance efficiently in sec:apt-tune. Additionally, we explain our self-knowledge distillation technique that improves pruned LM's task performance with limited training expense in sec:momentum.",

In these cases, INLINEFORM0 prunes transformers' hidden dimension and INLINEFORM1 prunes attention heads in MHA and internal neurons in FFN layers. By learning the pruning masks and adjusting the ranks dynamically in the APT adapter, we can achieve the goal defined in sec:formulation where the tuning parameter number INLINEFORM2 increases to maintain task performance and the LM parameter size INLINEFORM3 decreases to support more efficient training and inference.

To avoid extra training costs, we keep duplicating the tuning student layers as teachers during fine-tuning to reduce total training time. Meanwhile, frozen parameters are shared between the student and teacher model during training to reduce memory consumption. We edit the distillation objective in CoFi BIBREF12 as",

In these cases, we only train LMs with adaptive tuning strategies with supervised fine-tuning objectives without distillation. In such settings, w/o INLINEFORM1 can be recognized as a PEFT method with tuning parameters' sizes adaptively changing during fine-tuning. Hence, the inference efficiency of the trained LMs are the same as full fine-tuning and LoRA. Without pruning, the task performance of RoBERTa reaches 94.4 for SST2 and 87.5 for MNLI (99.8% fine-tuned LM performance on average). The average performance of the LLaMA model also achieves 96.6% to its LoRA-tuned counterpart. In addition, we surprisingly find that the RoBERTA training speed with w/o INLINEFORM2 is even 21% faster than full fine-tuning while costing only 62.2% memory. In the meantime, the training memory cost of w/o INLINEFORM3 in LLaMA tuning is higher than LoRA. The reason is that the tuning parameter number of will grow larger than static LoRA-tuning.

Without INLINEFORM1 , the model's performance decreases to 93.2/84.4, leading to a similar performance as the LoRA+Prune baseline (93.0/84.0). Moreover, equally increasing parameters across all layers instead of adding parameters based on salience notably hurts the task accuracy (84.4 on MNLI compared to 86.4). At the same time, INLINEFORM2 helps the model converge 16% faster than static LoRA training. For ablation results in LLaMA models shown in tab:llama-ablation, we observe that INLINEFORM3 recovers the model performance under 50% pruning setting (38.2 compared to 35.8). However, the difference under 70% pruning is insignificant. Meanwhile, if calculating the pruning parameter salience without using kurtosis to consider outliers parameters, the pruned LM's performance substantially drops from 50.0 to 38.1. We conclude that INLINEFORM4 substantially improves LM training speed and end-task performance. For large LLaMA-based LM pruning, and outlier parameters are essential to recovering the pruned large LLaMA-based models' capabilities.",

One can improve performance-efficiency trade-offs with better memory-efficient distillation, parameter sharing, and re-allocation strategies. Furthermore, because of the hardware features of Ampere-architecture GPUs, layer dimensions divisible by 8 for FP16 and divisible by 16 for Int8 would reach more realistic speedups.

APT significantly reduces training and inference costs and contributes to lower resource consumption for a wide range of applications. This could have a positive environmental impact but might lead to potential model misuse due to lower resource requirements. Additionally, while APT does not introduce new ethical concerns, it might inherit existing issues in language models, for example, biases in training data. We explicitly ask users of APT to be aware of these risks and follow best practices in data selection and model monitoring to mitigate potential harms.",

In particular, the results of STS-B cannot be reproduced when conducting CoFi distillation with LoRA parameters tuned only, so we exclude the comparison on STS-B. Among the other seven tasks in the GLUE benchmark, we find that tasks with relatively smaller dataset sizes, namely CoLA, MRPC, and RTE, reach superior performance gain when using .

At the same time, under the same pre-tuning pruning settings, performs better than the LLMPruner baseline on all four evaluation tasks, indicating the effectiveness of considering outlier parameters in large LM pruning. Nonetheless, the LoRA+Prune baseline reaches slightly better results than when pruning 13B models, illustrating that there is still room for improving pre-tuning pruning methods in future works. More specifically, among the four tasks we use for evaluating large LMs, TruthfulQA benefits the most from Alpaca fine-tuning. We can see that reaches superior results on TruthfulQA than existing baselines regardless of model size. The LM's capabilities on ARC and HellaSawg downgrade the most when pruning large LM before fine-tuning, implying possibilities of catastrophic forgetting in this paradigm.",

When ablating the dynamic layer mapping strategy in our self-distillation approach, the LM performance decreased by 0.8% with similar training time and memory consumption. When training without distillation objectives (w/o self-distillation), the LM performance drops by 1.7%. Nonetheless, the training is slightly faster with less memory costs. These results present that using distillation objectives for better LM task performance will sacrifice training efficiency as a tradeoff. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the comparisons with existing static knowledge distillation strategies, using the converged full-parameter fine-tuned LM (FT teacher) and LoRA-tuned LM (LoRA teacher) as the teacher model. We calculate the time consumption for both teacher and student training when using these distillation baselines. As shown in tab:ablate-distillation, using fully fine-tuned models as the teacher will incur more memory cost than dense model fine-tuning, while only consumes 70%. In the meantime, the training convergence speed of training is two times faster than the traditional knowledge distillation method with a fine-tuned teacher. Furthermore, using a LoRA-tuned model as the teacher will result in extremely slow training speed. In addition, simply tuning the LoRA layers with knowledge distillation objectives doesn't help reduce the training memory consumption, as the memory consumption is still 96.1% than full fine-tuning.",

The accuracy reaches 48.6 and 47.4 when not pruning before tuning, compared to 46.6 and 44.7 when directly pruning to the target sparsity for both 7B and 13B models. Training the LM densely harms the model performance while costing extra memory for all other tasks.
